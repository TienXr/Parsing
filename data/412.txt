 <p> Loved this book also, this author really does go the extra mile, at least in this series of books. The way each book follows from one generation to the next, makes it  really nice. Shiloh made me tear up at one point! Guess I'm just an old softie. </p>

 <p> I thoroughly enjoy reading r. William Rogers' writing. There are some issues with downloading some of the books, for example, with this download came the little 1/4 at the beginning or ending of some words. It would show up all of a sudden out of nowhere. The plot in this little book is quite good and Rogers sows a good job of I keeping you up to date with all the characters. There are some names in the wrong place but I really enjoyed reading the book. It's not often you can find someone who can weave a good story around a good plot and keep it clean and interesting. Great job rWR. </p>

 <p> I like the new beginning for Sue. She deserves the new life!  Like how everyone works together and makes things happen.  Sorry to see more of the same old same.  Get a new idea.  Things can change up a little.  Years have passed and then there is 2 children.  I guess that really doesn't matter.  I like info and like to see how it all turns out.  Almost done with this one... </p>

 <p> The book in general was just ok, I noted more than 200+ errors. It should have been edited before publishing to Amazon. The errors were as many on 5+ on any given page which also was so distracting for me as I am avid reader. I constantly got frustrated with the errors and had to stop reading it. PROOFREAD BEFORE YOU PUBLISH PEOPLE!!! </p>

 <p> Obviously, I enjoyed this book.  Otherwise, I wouldn't be rating book #5 in the Series.  The whole series was well worth reading....good wholesome family friendly and the gospel message skillfully woven through out. </p>

 <p> This is a very well written series of stories. The author moves the story line forward from each book so that you want to know what happens. The characters are interesting and fully rounded. The historical elements seem to be in line. I enjoy reading about the life and struggles of this area and especially of a horse ranch. The other thing I like about these books is that the main characters suffer and sometimes die which makes the story less predictable. The Christianity woven throughout the books isn't preachy but is truly part of the story and part of the characters. With the dangerous and frightening lives these people lived they turned to God for comfort and strength. </p>

 <p> Another Great book by R. William Rogers </p>

 <p> His series of book re: Shiloh Ranch should be best sellers. I have enjoyed each of the five books and was so glad to learn there was Books 6 and 7. </p>

 <p> Book had a lot of grammar errors. That took away from reading. Grammar errors were not due to dialect. The fraction 1/4 appeared every few lines or sentences. Glad I read it, but disappointed with book as a whole. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Another page turner </p>

 <p> What a blessing to read about family values and morals and still have such exciting plots. I appreciate the lack of vulgar language and graphic sexual content that today's authors feel like they need to appeal to their audiences to sell their junk. Seems like John " Revolting" and the Hollywood crowd saw how that type of smut sold (pulp fiction) and now it is stinking up films and. T. V. Looking forward to #6, </p>
