 <p> It's enjoyable for a senior citizen to revisit some of the simple pleasures from her childhood. The sound isn't always great, but the copyright is 1952, so I don't expect perfection. I'm so pleased that these old programs are available. I haven't finished watching the whole set, but I do so hope that the episode in which Marion Lorne wanders around repeating, &#34;I wish you could feel my hands&#34; is included. </p>

 <p> In the 1950's,  Tv was live. It was theater in a video format. The idea of video taping was done by Desi Arnaz and Lucy for I LOVE LUCY. However most of the shows of the early 1950's were recorded  on kinadcope (a form of rerecordable video tape). These tapes were most of the time wiped clean to record again, this is why we lost most of the classic TV  shows of the 1950However someone , I do not know who, at the film library of USLA (University of Southern California Los Angeles) found the tapes of Mr Peepers and restore them.The series is the story of the  mild mannered Jefferson Peepers, who  is an everyman that life happens to him. Good deeds goes bad ro Peepers, by in the end it all works out.Wally Cox underplays Peepers with charms and makes you want to win in the end. Such actors as Tony Randall, Water Matthau and Jack Warden made their first YV appeareance on the Peeper's show and you can seem on these first 26 episodes of this classic series.So does this show hold up after 50 years, in one word--YES! Does  rate with some  of today's comedies-I think it is better, you see where the humor of the past is mimiced in the presentMaybe if the kids can handle the black and white show, slip this DVD in their family viewing , they may enjoy this as much as Full House, The Nanny or The Fact of Life. However for adults, this show is great Television at its bestBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLDWould someone ask S'Mores Entertainment to release a second volume soon? </p>

 <p> This is an absolutely delightful, subtle, and twee comedy from the year 1952.  It will prove odd to many juveniles; there are no car chases, explosions, four letter words, or sex scenes.  You have to pay attention to the dialogue, which is spoken not shouted.  Mr. Peepers is a gentle and kind junior high science teacher, and the world seems to get the better of him...but not for long.  Wally Cox is one of a kind, and so is Marion Lorne, who plays the principal's wife.  Tony Randall and Jack Warden make guest appearances in these live performances, and they are entertaining.  But in every episode, Cox is the focus, and his low-key humor can't be matched by anyone...at any time.  This is wonderful television from a much kinder and quieter era. </p>

 <p> The previous reviewer, Bennet Pomerantz, is mixed up about early TV time shifting techniques. In the early 1950s the only method available for recording live TV was the Kinescope process, in which a 16mm or 35mm film camera was mounted in front of a television monitor and the program was recorded on film, not tape. Although Bing Crosby Enterprizes experimented with a crude form of video tape as early as 1951, the picture quality was unacceptable. Usable video tape didn't become available until 1956 when Ampex introduced the first video tape recorders. Desilu Productions early on decided to film the I Love Lucy shows instead of airing them live, because non networked TV outlets complained about the poor quality of the Kinescope filmed copies that other live shows gave them to air. Thus directly filming shows instead of presenting them live while simultaneously recording them on Kinescope film for immediate rebroadcast became popular. Some artists, such as Jackie Gleason, insisted that all their Kinescopes be saved for use many years in the future. That's why all the Gleason shows, and aparently these Peepers Kinescopes too, are still with us. Many of the Kinescopes that were "bicycled" to outlying affiliates survived, but most were either trashed or just plain lost. The shows that were directly filmed instead of broadcast live and Kinescoped had a much better chance of survival, and the picture quality is vastly better. Just how good these Mister Peepers DVDs will look and sound is yet to be discovered when they are released. I hope the studio did a good job on them, because I recall watching this show with my dad in the early '50s and we really enjoyed it. I hope they include the vintage commercials too. </p>

 <p> I love fifties television and am looking forward to seeing "Our Miss Brooks" and "The Life Of Riley" released on DVD some day. Both shows ran for years on radio and television. Mr. Peepers ran for two years and then tanked. I can see why. While Wally Cox was good at delivering his lines, this character was too one dimensional and the show was too slow moving to  sustain itself in a long run. Mr. Peepers shoulld have been a secondary character in a bigger show, for example, Mr. Peepers might have been another teacher at Madison High School where Miss Brooks (Eve Arden) worked. Early tv fans will need to see an apisode or two of this but even I couldn't get interested enough to watch all of these. </p>

 <p> For many years I only had one episode of this cute show, and thought there were no more in existence. I was happy to find this set at a Borders and bought it. I haven't had trouble playing any of the discs, and am really enjoying them. I was born in 1965 so I don't remember this show, but it's so cute and subtle, and I prefer the older shows to later sitcoms where everyone just yaks away with trite and unfunny lines, and every other joke is filthy.The quality is pretty good, sometimes the sound is too low, but it's in the kinescopes, not the DVD. I hope the rest of this series is released. Mr. Peepers rules! </p>

 <p> Sadly, someone really did screw up in the packaging of this one; my first set was a mess with mislabelled disks and two with the same episodes, meaning seven episodes were missing; I got a replacement from Amazon and it was fine -- except for some reason there was an extra fifth disk that was a copy of another one. That's why I am giving the set four stars. So check your disks when you get your set, but then...Savor one of the very few fifties sitcoms that holds up (and even though I'm an I LOVE LUCY fan, even that show is getting so old that the fascination is increasingly anthropological rather than a true, direct delight in the "wacky" goings on). PEEPERS has the sweet fifties-whimsical tone of GERALD MCBOING BOING or HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON. Wally Cox's portrayal is, in its way, a kind of less tortured proto-Stephen Wright.And then you get a young Tony Randall (or Anthony Randall, as he is first billed) using his stage smarts to breathe incredible life into the character of Peepers' colleague and friend. In addition, the unearthing of these shows means that anyone who has ever loved Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara on BEWITCHED or enjoyed her memorable turn as the mother in STRANGERS ON A TRAIN now gets two-dozen-plus new performances by her; her dithery shtick steals many an episode. (Peepers: "Have a good weekend!" Lorne: "Oh, yes, we will, we will ... we're having artichokes!")And even in this first season, we get to watch the budding romance between Peepers and the school nurse. Patricia Benoit's Miss Remington, with her early-Mia-Farrow short haircut and a fetching bit of an overbite, comes off as a quietly sexy small-town girl, and her eternal solicitous gaze at Peepers seems utterly plausible and warms the heart.The show takes its time, with long, casual exchanges between the characters that no wacky Desilu show ever had time for. As with most shows, it took a little while to gel. The first disk and a bit dwell in a little too much dopey slapstick, and only after them are Randall and Benoit introduced (despite the frequently adduced factoid, Walter Matthau plays the coach only in the pilot, which is included in the set). But by the end of the second disk, you're hooked and happy to return "next week" as Cox reminds us to at the end of every show. I can't wait for the second season to come out (it'd better!).As to quality, I am mystified at some of the reviewers' complaints. As kinescopes (film made of a TV monitor, so that live shows could be rebroadcast out west), these are quite nice compared to what some of them look like after all this time. MR. PEEPERS never looked like FATHER KNOWS BEST because it was either seen done live on flickering little sets or as kinescopes. Sound in the first half-dozen or so episodes is a little dicey, especially since Cox was soft-spoken, but turning up the volume does the trick.And as for performance glitches, it is admirable how few there are. If you're really waiting for them, you sense that here and there someone has dropped a line and the others are filling in. But it's not as if people are tripping over furniture, or going blank as to what to say next and breaking each other up a la blooper reels. If anything, the live aspect is exciting -- when a scene is over, often the camera will focus on some trivial set piece or Marion Lorne will be given 30 seconds of "business," just so that everyone can run over to the next set and launch into a scene taking place the next day (often in different clothes!). It's like watching little plays.Most fifties TV is tough viewing today -- just try sitting through more than one episode of PRIVATE SECRETARY, for example; America and its sense of humor have changed vastly since the Eisenhower era. MR. PEEPERS was one for the ages, and given that I used to think it was all but lost, hooray for the UCLA archive (and the show's creators, for donating the kinescopes). Very soon, let's have Season Two -- with disks properly pressed and packaged. </p>

 <p> I bought this 4 disk set only to discover that disk #1 wouldn't load at all, and the last two episodes on disk four wouldn't play. It was sent back for an exchange. The second set was the same exact thing. After returning that one for a second exchange, the third set was defective in the same manner. Since I tried three copies and they were all defective in the same places, I returned the last one for an refund. This is too bad as I love Mister Peepers.S'more Entertainment needs better quality control. It's hard to believe they aren't aware the of these major problems. Beware! </p>

 <p> This DVD set is really fun to watch.  Wally Cox is utterly charming as Mr. Peepers, and his comedic timing is perfection.  The hilarious predicaments he gets into are slightly offbeat and entertaining.  The rest of the cast is excellent, too, particularly the dithering Marion Lorne and the great actors Walter Matthau and Tony Randall.  I intended to just watch the first couple of shows and then save the rest for later, but I couldn't stop watching.  Now I've watched them all twice, and I've only had the set for two days.  This set was recorded from the original kinescopes, which were all that was available, and in the first show and a couple of subsequent ones, there is some difficulty hearing the words in a place or two.  The series is also in black and white, of course, but these drawbacks are minimal compared to the quality of the acting. I can't get enough of Mr. Peepers, and now I'm going to be waiting for the second boxed set to come out so that we can see him get married. </p>

 <p> I have both Mr. Peepers volume oneand two on DVD.  I loved this endearingshow, so I emailed S'more Entertainment( info@smoreent.com ), and asked ifthe whole set would be coming out onDVD.  This is the disheartening responseI got from them:Thank you so much for your kind note. Sadly, the DVD market has shrunk to the point where we can no longer sell enough product to justify the cost of transferring from film to video, digitizing and then restoring the elements, let alone the cost of authoring the DVD and creating packaging. Unless we can find a way to change the distribution model completely, I fear the final 2 seasons of "Mister Peepers" may not see the light of day.We're exploring ways to reach consumers directly, not relying on stores and on line sites as the series is much loved.PLEASE HELP MAKE MR. PEEPERS FINAL TWOSEASONS A REALITY.  WRITE TOinfo@smoreent.com and BEG them toput out Mr. Peepers Vol 3 and 4.  Ifwe can get enough responses, theyjust might see that there IS a marketout there for these shows.  It can'thurt to ask. </p>

 <p> In the late 1940s and early 1950s, much of television production was broadcast live and, prior to a nationwide feed, kinescopes (films of live broadcasts from television monitors) were made as a way to broadcast shows at a later date in different parts of the country and, in some cases, for later syndication purposes.  Unfortunately, many of the kinescopes from early television shows were either lost or destroyed and, consequently, a good portion of early American television history has been lost to the ages.  Thankfully, this is not the case with "Mister Peepers," one of television's earliest weekly situation comedies.  Supposedly, 102 episodes out of a total series production of 127 reside at the UCLA Film & Television Archive and, from this collection, comes this first TV-on-DVD release from S'more Entertainment, a new DVD releasing company.This set includes the first 26 episodes of the series along with the series' pilot, which features an unbilled Walter Matthau in the role of "Mr. Burr," Jefferson Junior High's coach (Matthau would not become a series regular).  In addition to Matthau, the series featured up-and-coming stars like Tony Randall and Jack Warden.  Marion Lorne, later "Aunt Clara" in "Bewitched," is also in the cast.  But the show really belongs to Wally Cox.  Unlike the cynical and often tasteless humor found in many modern sitcoms, there's a "kinder, gentler" humor found in "Mister Peepers," and Cox is just perfect in the role of Robinson Peepers, the good-hearted science teacher.  Technically, the shows are crude when compared to modern day productions.  While very watchable, there are some scratches and film specks from time-to-time (one of the early episodes has a bad scratch for a long portion) and there is noticeable audio hiss present on some episodes.  And, unfortunately, the UCLA Film & Television logo appears from time-to-time in the bottom right hand corner (couldn't this have been done on the credits only).  But the positives of this DVD set far outweigh the negatives and what really shines through on "Mister Peepers" is both the wonderful writing and ensemble acting by a very talented cast performing live.  In addition to the pilot episode, there are some other extras on the DVD set that, while not essential, enhance one's appreciation of Wally Cox and the show."Mister Peepers" is highly recommended for both fans of early sitcoms as well as anyone interested in early American live television broadcasting.  From a historical perspective, this is one of the most important TV-on-DVD releases available on the market.  Let's hope that S'more episodes from this wonderful comedy series are released in the future. </p>
