 <p> Like most black films it could have been better,the actors were okay but the writing was juvenile and lacked depth. </p>

 <p> I was not sure about this. Storyline is good. Has comic and drama moments. I only know of two actors in this . I actually enjoyed this movie about a young teacher who was hurt by her ex,  her dedication other students, and her friends. She is on a journey to loving again. </p>

 <p> Outside of the attractive girl on the cover, this film's storyline and substance left much to be desired. But I do commend the producers for getting it made. </p>

 <p> i was a little confused by the strange range of reviews.  they were heavy enough on the negative side that i almost didn't watch.  glad i did.  it really is pretty good.  some of the acting could be better, and about ten minutes of it was wasted on unnecessary filler.  still, i liked it.  one of these days i might watch it again.one thing i really love is the song played at the end of the credits, &#34;it's only you&#34; by felix linden.  liked it so much, i coughed up a whole $.99 for it.  now that's a song worth listening to. </p>

 <p> Thank God for Amazon Prime because I would have been highly upset to have paid to rent this &#34;movie.&#34;  I was trying to make it to the end but just couldn't!  Watching someone barf right into someone lap while on a ferris wheel is not my cup of tea!  This film definitely proves that you don't have to go to film school to write a script.  Before I die, I guess I'll take a stab at it and I can bet it'll be 10 times better than this crap! </p>

 <p> Its a little budgeted but aside from that, the situation is realistic and the leads are attractive. That little boy had me laughing. I definitely laughed quite a few times. Id love to watch this again with a group of people. </p>

 <p> One could tell that ametuer actors were used. Some acted better than others. Ayo (new boyfriend)did a good job. The first male actor was not so good. The story line was nice and I'm sure it's every woman's wish to hear the thoughts of a man. Sure would save time. Overall, a good film if you just want something interesting to pass time. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Not the worst film ever </p>

 <p> Ok the acting was horrible, it was definitely an amateur work but I guess exposure for the lead actress Sherial McKinney et al. She looks so much like a younger Halle Berry, without trying but also seemed to try to act like her as well. the story reminded me of a cross between Boomerang with the Eddie cheating on her and coming back and it reminds me about a reverse role of the movie where the guy can read women's thoughts. It doesn't explain how that happened for her to hear men's thoughts other than she woke up in the library and read a bunch of books. It was predictable in that you knew how the movie ended.  I can't believe I watched this  but I skipped through this after the first five minutes. I surfed the net most of the time. </p>

 <p> This is a cute movie with a cute story line. However, I wasn't impressed by the acting. It is a relatable story to any woman who has ever been hurt and has a cute ending. It's an ok movie for girls night, but wasn't my favorite. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Cute, but kinda slow going. </p>
