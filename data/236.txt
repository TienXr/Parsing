 <p> This was a great movie about retired people with problems that surface at that time of life. All the actors were major ones and did a great job. </p>

 <p> The audience for this film may be people over sixty, but its message has appeal for anyone over twenty.Set in a retirement community in Florida, the characters humorously reflect what it's like to be retiredand find meaning and fulfillment in the "golden years."  The acting, especially by the women, is terrific.And the guys are charming, and try their best to overcome their fears and limitations.This is definitely an entertaining film about a part of our lives that most of us try not to think aboutuntil we're retired! </p>

 <p> I found this movie very endearing. It shows the difficulty ofgetting on with life after losing a spouse. But life does go onand one just has to pick up the pieces and go on. Sometimes loveis better the second time around. I should know!!!!!!Easy to watch and the actors are suited for their roles. I reallydid like it and can recommend it. </p>

 <p> A wonderful movie for people that have reached a point in life that is filled with experiences. It shows with great humor and sensitivity how to cope with everyday situations and many of the human frailties that we all have.  In the end it will leave you with a warm feeling and a smile on your face. </p>

 <p> Now that I am living in a retirement community, I see some of the same characters from this movie. Life imitates fiction. It is a comedy but has it's serious moments as well. Sometimes pulls at your heart strings. I only recommend this for us seniors. lol </p>

 <p> I hadn't thought about this movie for a while and came looking for it. So glad to find it at Amazon Prime! I'm a lifelong Dyan Cannon fan, but it's full of other wonderful stars. Boynton Beach Club is sad, funny, and hopeful. I don't think you have to be a Baby Boomer to enjoy it, if you're truthful enough with yourself to accept that many of us will be facing loneliness in the latter years, and yes, we all will grow old.....if we're lucky enough to live that long.  How we deal with it determines our happiness. </p>

 <p> Senior Citizens Get Their Due in a Serviceable Romcom </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Give director/co-screenwriter Susan Seidelman (Gaudi Afternoon) credit for focusing on a segment sadly neglected in current cinema, single sixty-somethings facing lives without their lifetime partners. There is a gentle, loping quality to this seriocomic 2006 character-driven comedy, but it also doesn't feel quite substantial enough to provide genuine insight into their difficult situations. The various storylines rarely feel more complex than an episode ofThe Golden Girls, but the principal actors - some rarely seen outside of guest appearances on reruns ofMurder, She Wrote- compensate to a great degree.There are three plot threads that intertwine over the course of the movie. Long-married Marilyn faces an unexpected tragedy when her exercise-obsessed husband is killed by a thoughtless woman backing her car out of a driveway. She decides to join the Boynton Beach Bereavement Club (the movie's original title) upon the prodding of Lois, a still-sexy, flirtatious interior decorator who is the unofficial social leader of the club. As Marilyn faces her anger and loneliness, Lois finds herself drawn to Donald, a younger man whom she believes is a real estate tycoon. Also in the club is Harry, who fancies himself a ladies' man and wants to help Jack, newly widowed and prime bait for the widows in the retirement community. Jack isn't ready to date until he meets Sandy, a very interested woman who isn't quite what she claims. Harry, on the other hand, tries online dating, but he finds trouble with the woman who seems like the ideal match for him.It's nice to see actors who gained prominence in the late 1960's and early 1970's receive substantive roles in their autumnal years. Brenda Vaccaro (Midnight Cowboy) as Marilyn and Len Cariou (The Four Seasons) as Jack deliver the strongest performances because their characters undergo the grief and recovery of losing a loved one. Vaccaro has two particularly compelling scenes - the first where Marilyn introduces herself to the club and cannot conceal the rage over her husband's death, the second when Marilyn finally faces the woman who ran her husband over. Dyan Cannon (Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice) as Lois and Joseph Bologna as Harry (My Favorite Year) primarily provide comic relief. Both are as likeable as ever, though it's rather disheartening to see Cannon so surgically altered. The same is true of Sally Kellerman (M*A*S*H) who has to play the concealed Sandy close to the vest. As Donald, Michael Nouri (Flashdance) plays a character with secrets of his own as he pursues Lois. Seidelman's thoughtful commentary is the only extra on the 2007 DVD. </p>

 <p> A Bogus But Amusing Look at Florida Retirees </p>

 <p> As a resident of Florida, I was curious about "Boynton Beach Club". It's fun to watch, as long as you can distance yourself and not take any of it seriously. The 'story' revolves around people in their senior years who try to form new relationships, often based on lies and deceit. Many of them are as shallow as a puddle, and not very dignified. I have a better relationship with my cat. But I enjoyed the ensemble cast, especially the original "Sweeney Todd" - the wonderful Len Cariou.But truthfully, the best thing about viewing such a movie is being able to read others' comments afterward. And I would welcome answers to the immortal question: Why are people who enjoy Early Bird Specials such a target for ridicule? I've always hated big meals late at night, and I'm not even old enough to live in a so-called "retirement community". </p>

 <p> This film about lonely seniors is funny and touching.  Brenda Vaccaro and Sally Kellerman still has their famous throaty voices and Dyan Cannon has lost non of her physical attributes although she did something to her face and lips reminiscent of the scene played by Goldie Hawn following her lip injections in the "First Wives Club."Joe Bologna and Rene Taylor are brilliant.  Len Cariou is a convincing sad and lonely widower and Michael Nouri is sexier than ever.Boynton Beach Club </p>

 <p> Fun movie with load of stars of yesteryear. A movie about various seniors in a Florida retirement community trying to enjoy life by looking for that &#34;Fountain of youth&#34; . If you over 60 you will love it, under 60 , you probably will not understand. </p>

 <p> Worth two and a half chuckles.  Affluent Florida retirees cope with isolation and bereavement by forging human connections, often reverting to the sex-obsessed years and patterns of junior high.  Don't get hung up on status and trappings, the film seems to say, if you find someone with whom you genuinely connect.I would write more, but I've got to get to the Early Bird special buffet that starts at 3:30 PM... </p>

 <p> Ugh, I saw this movie in the movie theaters with my mom, neither of us knowing anything in advance about the movie itself. My mom enjoyed the film, I for the most part did not. Granted the acting was great and the movie had some VERY funny moments...... HOWEVER, the storyline wasn't to my liking.Be forewarned, "Boynton Beach Club" isn't geared for anyone under the age of 50 years old! This movie is geared to the baby boomer generation and above as this movie deals with retired senior citizens living in a retirement community, death & bereavement of a spouse you've been with for decades, and re-entering the dating scene after being married to the same person for 30 years or more. </p>

 <p> and if I'm not mistaken, they aren't, or at least weren't available.  But I had the BBC Jones, and had to get at leastA copy of it!  If you're 39+ and romantic at all, starting to get scared of getting a little older, and wouldlike to watch a very SUNNY movie that is really pretty insightful and &#34;feel-good&#34;, I wouldn't hesitate tobuy Boynton Beach Club.  It's nice to be able to relate a little to a movie, especially since it's not loadedwith hip-hop, rap, tons of bad language and useless violence, and CGI.  Fun movie!  Thought provoking.Your tweens and teens won't like it.  :  )BUY IT! </p>

 <p> A must-see for baby boomers AND their children. Topics are presented that have never been discussed in a movie before -- the things you never say but happen anyway. A serious topic, which isn't taken too seriously. For many people, the ones to whom I've talked, this movie speaks for them and the things they were afraid to say out loud. See it! </p>
