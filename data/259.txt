 <p> We were glad to get this 3rd season of Nash Bridges from Amazon.  this show was funny.  I personally enjoyed watching Jodi Lynn O'Keefe grow up on this show before starting her career.  The price was reasonable, and the delivery was fast. </p>

 <p> Don Johnson does a superb Job in this set in San Francisco series. Rather than killing a couple of dozen people like so many Hollywood cop shows. They seem to know that Circumstantial evidence is usually better than direct (eye witness testimony) evidence. Johnson plays a person with real flaws. </p>

 <p> Perhaps my favorite Cop show </p>

 <p> As good as it was going, it stopped!!! There has to be a continuation of Nash Bridges, I don't want to have to but Seasons 4,5 & 6 from Japan!!Other than that, this series got better than the first two. The storylines were great, the plots also and Don & Cheech jelled well. This is one of my favorite shows! </p>

 <p> Nash Bridges was one of my favorite shows of the 70's.  Thanx for bringing back the good ole days, and hope you will continue to bring back more of the same.  Can't wait till number 4 arrives.  Television today; for the most part; stinks. </p>

 <p> Wish they would release the rest of the seasons. It seems to be a problem with a lot of other TV series. Still waiting for "Walker Season 8" (what's up this one, seeing even the Final Season was released over 2 yrs. ago?), "Fresh Prince of Bel Air Season 6", "Starsky & Hutch Season 5", "George Lopez Season 3", plus, etc. Wonder what's happening why the rest of these shows are not being released on DVD? Nash Bridges is one of my favorites, just like the others I mentioned above, but it's really frustrating if you start to buy the seasons that are available without realizing the the rest may never come out. I call it a major ""rip-off" by the DVD industry. Being very, very careful about what buying from now - after all, it's my money they're taking. The last season of "The Shield" was out in no time at all - why can't they do the same with other shows? I know there are contracts. permits, etc. involved, but please - give the buyer a warning if they have to wait around for years to complete their collections. Who knows - they might not be around then! </p>

 <p> Ok let me be clear about this....I love this series. It dominated my Friday nights from 1996-2001. BUT, this is not what I remembered and we should get a price break on it; however; this is to RATE the item. And, I HATE rating it like I do, cause I loved this series.So, here goes...If I were to rate it based on the action & storylines I remember--I'd be 5 stars.If I were to rate it based on the lack of the music or music changes from the original CBS airings--It'd be NO STARS.Now, I am usually an easy-going person. But, when I want the COMPLETE SERIES or the COMPLETE SEASON, I want it complete & unaltered. That is not what I got. One episode for example--REVELATIONS; is a mess. One of my most favorite episodes of this season and truthfully, the "new" ending really sucks.At the end as Nash was driving away in the 'Cuda, you heard Van Morrison's "Into The Mystic". I know because I had to call the production office to find the name of the song.Alas, it was replaced by something else and less meaningful. Same as the episode "Sacraments"--the song at the end (in the original airing) was Eric Clapton's "My Father's Eyes"; again replaced with something less meaningful and to me, degrades the series and what it accomplished. I haven't seen the entire season, but I would bet most of the really great music has been altered. That is what made this series what it was at times--the music.If I were not so dedicated to the series, and didn't want to waste my time recording it on DVR and transferring it to my own DVDS, I would stop ordering future seasons. I am half tempted to do so.....BUT...I asked for it on DVD and as my mother said "be careful what you wish for" as well as "having a thing isn't so pleasing as wanting"....so I will have to deal with it. I would encourage people who remember the series for what it was to contact Paramount and voice your displeasure, as I intend to do. I thought seasons 1 & 2 were "over-sights", clearly it is not.The good things? The packaging is still good--plastic case designed to hold multiple discs, a real space-saving design. The item arrived in great shape and when promised. But don't expect any special features.Overall, I will give it 3 stars; though I hope CBS can quit *crewing up a good thing. If it's the money deal, I would pay more for what I want & remember as opposed to cheap for cheap :) </p>
