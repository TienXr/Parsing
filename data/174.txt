 <p> THE BIGGEST SWERVE IN WRESTLING HISTORY!!!!!! </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Oh my godd what an ending to an okish pay per view. The ppv may not be 5 stars but the ending makes up for it here are my ratings and comments out of 5 stars.Match 1: Psicosis vs. Rey Misterio, Jr. - incredible high flying match. one of Psicosis's best I've ever seen with the match with Yoshihiro Tajiri 1st. This is when WCW was experementing with cruiserweights and seeing how the crowd would react to them. all I can say is that they brought it here RATING: *****Match 2: Big Bubba vs. John Tenta in a Carson Silver Dollar Match - not really a good match just think it as The Bossman vs. Earthquake and that will give you what I think of this match RATING: *Match 3: DDP vs. Hacksaw Duggan in a Taped Fists Match - this is a few months after DDP won battle bowl and he fueded with mid carders. pretty stupid match here. RATING: DUDMatch 4: The Nasty Boys vs. The Public Enema in a Dog Collar Match - I have always been a fan of dog collar matches dating back to Piper vs. Valentine and The Pitbulls vs. Raven and Stevie Richards and this is a pretty good brawl but it doesn't touch those two RATING: ***Match 5: Cruiserweight Champion Dean Malenko vs. Disqo Inferno - wow!!!!! what a back and forth battle here. Malenko was an awesome cruiserweight champion and Disqo had debuted months earlier and believe me this match doesn't suck and when you watch it you will want more. good one here RATING: ****1/4Match 6: Joe Gomez vs. Steve Mongo McMichael - man what a dumb match!!! Gomez is a huge jobber and is it just me or does everybody have Mongo!! Squash..everybody knew who would win this. RATING: 1/2*Match 7: U.S. Champion Konnan vs. Ric Flair - Konnan was an awsome us champion and he would turn heel months later. good solid matchup here but I always hate this ending. RATING: ***Match 8: The Giant &amp; Kevin Sullivan vs. Chris Benoit and Arn Anderson - giant sux.....sullivan is ok....benoit rules...and the enforcer rules...but this match sux. Benoit and Sullivan had their awesome falls count anywhere match and this is disapointing RATING: **1/2Match 9: Sting, Lex Luger, and Randy Savage vs. Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and ................Hulk Hogan - wow was I seriously shocked!! nobody expected it!!! and boy did everybody hate hogan after this......not a good match but the pshycology is incredible and the swerve saves it big time. RATING: *****---ONE OF THE BEST WCW PPV EVER SO GET IT! </p>

 <p> WCW Bash at the Beach 1996 was a really great event.The best match of the night goes to Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis in one of the best ppv opening matches in wrestling history.The best moment of the night was the Hulk Hogan heel turn. The greatest turn in the history of wrestling. The interview after the match where the ring fills up with aal this garbage was great too!!! </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> WCW's Most Significant PPV </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>
  05-26-2008  
<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I called Starrcade '97 the worst PPV just because of its main event (Hogan/Sting). I would have to say WCW Bash At The Beach '96 was one of its best because this is the night that WCW took over the Monday Night Wars and started a near 2 year run of kicking Vince McMahon's hindend!As for the card itself, its pretty good with the main event being the most significant:Psychosis vs. Rey Mysterio - Great opener. There was a good pop for Mysterio while almost no heel heat for Psychosis. That still doesn't stop this match from being a big highlight reel! Ends when Mysterio countered a top rope "Razor's Edge" (called Splash Mountain in Mexico) into a hurancanrana for the win!John Tenta (RIP) vs. Big Bubba Rogers (RIP) (Silver Dollar on a Pole match) - The former Earthquake took on the the former Big Bossman (at this point) in this match. Slow and dull but mercifully short!DDP vs. Jim Duggan (Taped Fist Match) - DDP was a big heel here going against "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan. This was for Page's Battlebowl ring. Much like the previous match, nothing to write home about except Page's heel heat. Ends when DDP catches "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan in his "Diamond Cutter" (known as the RKO for today's fans) for the win.Nasty Boys vs. Public Enemy (Dog Collar chain match) - Fun matchup as the P.E. (RIP to both men) and the Nasties got busy here! Was pretty much a Texas Tornado match because tags were impossible here! Nasties win but the fight continues well after the match.Dean Malenko (c) vs. Disco Inferno (Cruiserweight Title match) - Shockingly good! I expected Dean to be excellent but Disco actually showed flashes of being a good wrestler and held his own with Malenko! Dean retains the Cruiserweight Title.Mongo McMichael vs. Joe Gomez - Totally skip this one! Its horrid! The other two crapfest matches (Tenta/Bubba and DDP/Duggan) were at least watchable! Ends when McMichael gives Gomez his version of the tombstone piledriver.Konnan (c) vs. Ric Flair (U.S. title match) - Decent bout. Konnan is a good performer but Flair carries this one. It even sees Woman get physical in the match with a punt kick to the "family jewels" on Konnan and hitting him with her high heel shoe! Flair wins the match and the U.S. title.Chris Benoit/Arn Anderson vs. Kevin Sullivan/The Giant - Not a good match BUT it does feature some forshadowing which led to the Chris Benoit/Kevin Sullivan feud which spilled over into real life as Woman (the late Nancy Sullivan) sided with Benoit both on and off camera against her then-husband Kevin Sullivan. I won't go into the whole story because we know how it ended and we know it wasn't pretty.I'd give the match itself one star BUT the sad events that came soon afterwards and its ramifications to the people involved (Benoit/Nancy/Kevin) over the next 10 years or so makes me give it a four star rating.Hall/Nash/mystery partner vs. Luger/Savage/Sting - This one was really talked about as even guys who were working for the WWE at the time was rumored to be coming to WCW. The match itself ended up being a regular tag as Hall & Nash didn't show up with their partner and Lex Luger got taken out earlier in the bout!Late in the match, Hulk Hogan showed up seemingly to help Sting and Savage but turned on them! Thus, the nWo was born and Hogan was a heel for the first time since 1983 in the AWA! The fallout was one of the wildest reactions from the crowd that I've personally ever seen! People were genuinely ready to kill Hogan! Even Tony Shivone said some words which I won't repeat here at the end.This event changed the course of WCW as they rode high for over a year before the fiasco called Starrcade '97. Still, if you want to see WCW at their highest, this one is recommended! </p>

 <p> This video has the birth of one of the strongest forces ever in WCW, the NWO.  This video is great from top to bottom. The first match between Rey and Psychosis is AMAZING 5++ stars just for that.  Malenko-Disco is  entertaining, as well as Flair vs Konnan and watching the Giant make short  work of Arn Anderson.  But YOU MUST get this video to see the end of  Hulkamania (well, until now).  This is required viewing for a wrestling  novice.  They must watch it. Also, if you're looking for a good buy, get  this, it's worth the 16.99, trust me! </p>

 <p> It seems like evryone are reviewing the main event and before i bought this off e bay i wanted to know what the matches were well you do now.1. Phsycosis vs. Rey Mysterio- Outstanding. This is the definition of hard work. The crowd was dead at the start. But rey and Phsycosis work so darn hard that the crowd are practically giving them a standing ovation at the end. **** out of *****2. John Tenta(earthquake) vs. Big BUbba(Boss Man)- This was some sort of gimick match but i cant really remember. ANyway its pretty bad but a few high spots. *1/23.DDP vs. Haksaw Jim Duggan Lord of the ring match- pretty good but it was just wat i expected good but nothing special- **1/24. Tag team dog collar match Nasty Boys vs. Public enemy(if your not an ECW fan than you dont know who Public enemy are....)Anyhoo this was a pretty good hardcore brawl with wats probably known as the strongest table ever.... some spots were really(i mean really) botched but then again who hired these guys for actually wrestling? ***5.Cruiserweight title- Dean Malenko vs. disco inferno- this was mostly a squash for Dean, but disco  did get some good moves in and sold Dean's moves quite well. Malenko shows why he really rules and Disco showed me he isnt a piece of crap, very good match ***1/26.Steve McMichael vs. Joe Gomez(something like that)- well take a guess. You should know what this matches rating is *7. Us. title Ric Flair vs. Konan. Kinda funny with Mrs. Elisabith and Nancy Benoit interfering on ric's behalf every three minutes. grquite a good match with a deserving winner wooooooooooooooo!***8. Kevin Sullavin and The GIANT vs. Benoit and Anderson- Hmm. not bad but the beginning is kinda slow with the horsemen touble teaming Sullavin. Gets pretty intense with Benoit and Sullavin going all over the set. Giant gives him the show stoppa for the W. Not a horrible match but over rated IMO. **3/49. Macho Man, Sting , lex Luger vs. Scott Hall and Kevin Nash and (the third man)- Alot of hype......... alot of mystery.........a heck of a lot on the line........ unbelievable drama....... and quite outstanding wrestling.This one is simply put a masterpiece. Great booking with Luger getting sent to the bak via fake injury to make it a 2 on 2 match. Great in ring phsicology by all 4 men..... and there it all went upwards. HOGAN!! ITS HOGAN HE is gonna teach this bad guys a leason. HE gets to the ring and.........WHAM! A new world order begins! The interview after the match is just as much of a masterpiece or even more than the actual match. *****!!!!!This video is EXTRemeLY reccomended for people who can enjoy a slower paced match. People who want just blood and broken necks than skip this and watch your CZW,FMW, XPW, or 3pw trash wrestling.True wrestling fans GET THIS while its under 30$!! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Must-have PPV </p>

 <p> Aside from maybe Spring Stampede '94 or WrestleWar '92, this is the greatest PPV the WCW ever put on.  This is a tremendous event with great heat, enthralling angles, and solid wrestling.Psychosis vs. Rey Mysterio - Virtually no heat for Psychosis, Mysterio gets an OK pop.  When these two hit the ring and put on a show for the crowd at hand, they get some great pops, including the huge pop for Mysterio's win.  This is one of the greatest openers at a PPV of all time. *****John Tenta vs. Big Bubba Rogers (Silver Dollar on a Pole match) - In this match, a sock filled with silver dollars is suspended on a pole, and one of these corpulent men must ascend this pole and retrieve the sock in order to use it.  Wow, what a compelling idea from WCW booking. DUD (Mercifully short, however, and that's a plus)DDP vs. Jim Duggan (Lord of the Ring match) - DDP wins battlebowl in May, but instead of getting the title shot, he spends the year feuding with losers like Marcus Bagwell and Jim Duggan.  Gotta love that WCW management.  DDP is a huge heel here.  He gets a cheap win or something in another mercifully short match. *Nasty Boys vs. Public Enemy (Dog Collar chain match) - Texas Tornado rules as these men are chained by the neck.  This is a really good hardcore brawl from these two teams with some really fun bumps.  The ending kinda sucked, but it was fun to watch them continue fighting after the conclusion. ***1/2Dean Malenko (c) vs. Disco Inferno (Cruiserweight Title match) - Good bout in which Disco works for once.  His gimmick normally prevented him from wrestling a competitive bout, but he undergoes some miraculous transformation and actually puts up a fight.  Deano Machino was great in this, per usual in 1996. ***3/4Mongo McMichael vs. Joe Gomez - Perfect piss break.  This one, unlike the other two crapfests on this card, is actually not short enough, but hey, one utter failure on a 9-match card for WCW isn't bad at all. DUDKonnan (c) vs. Ric Flair (U.S. title match) - Decent match in which Flair's psychology really gives it its edge.  Gotta love seeing him win a title and get a pop. **3/4Chris Benoit/Arn Anderson vs. Kevin Sullivan/The Giant - Overall, this is a pretty boring tag match.  There are a few bright spots, however.  The start of the match is pretty fun, and Sullivan/Benoit have another brawl at the end.  The brawl is short but wicked, and ends with involvement from Woman, further adding to the mystique of the Benoit/Sullivan/Woman triangle. * for the match, *** for the peripheral stuffHall/Nash/mystery partner vs. Luger/Savage/Sting - Well, this one's been talked about so much that it would be trite for me to explain it.  Really, this may sound cliche, but it's a must-see for all wrestling fans.  It's the climax of WCW.  The WCW would work for months and YEARS trying to match this in terms of excitement and drama, and they'd fall short every time.  Why?  Because it's virtually impossible to top that moment in terms of controversy. Oh, the match is just bleh, but the ending/post-match interview really make this. ** for the match ***** for the post-match drama and Tony Schiavone's end-quote: "Hulk Hogan...you can go to hell.  Straight to hell." </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Maybe WCW's best pay-per-view ever </p>

 <p> Wow, it's been a while, but it's great to look back on all this stuff.The first thing I noticed was that Mysterio and Psychosis got no pops when they came out, but after Mysterio won, he got a huge pop.  Their match was unreal.  Psychosis took two major high risk moves that hit, but still look like they hurt him bad.  One was a suicide dive over the top rope and the other was a senton bomb all the way from the top turnbuckle to the floor outside.  Man, that's a long way to go to land on your back like he did.  Ouch.  The match ends with Psychosis attempting a Razor's edge from the top rope but Mysterio reverses it into a hurricanrana.  Beautiful.  By the way, Mysterio looks darn skinny in this tape.There are some interesting matches that follow.  One is a match where a sock full of nickels is hung up high above the ring on a pole.  When's the last time you saw a pole match of any kind?  Very rare now, probably because they're crummy compared to ladder matches, but I think they're still fun.  Also there's a tornado tag team dog collar match featuring the Nasty Boys against Public Enemy, which I liked.  Fighting all around the arena with all kinds of weapons and a table that won't break.  I haven't seen either one of these teams in years.  I remember the Public Enemy was in WWF for maybe 2 weeks and then disappeared.Kevin Sullivan is in this pay per view.  Awesome.  And Benoit takes an insane dive into him AFTER the match is over.  Wow.The Giant gives a surprisingly good promo very early in his career.  I have to ask, "What happened?"Woman and Miss Elizabeth (those devilish women) look good in this, especially Woman in that white dress, but Woman is ALL over Mean Gene.  Mean Gene's reaction is classic.  Gosh, even 10 years ago Flair's skin was sagging pretty badly.  How old is that man?No Mike Tenay except for the first match.  Good.  Lots of Dusty Rhodes.  Also good.  I can never understand what that man is saying, if you wiiiill.Mongo McMichael vs. a jobber.  Awful.  Only bad match on the card though.  Debra brings a small dog to the ring.  Why?Malenko against Disco, who I never liked.  Malenko does a great springboard dropkick from the turnbuckle.  Excellence of Execution.  He powerbombs the heck out of Disco before finishing him off.  Man, I miss that Texas Cloverleaf.  NOBODY does that move now.  If Cena did that instead of the STF, I might actually like the guy for once.Hall and Nash in their first WCW match.  History right there.  Nash delivers an impressive power move to Sting.  Sometimes I forget that he had some strength.  Luger is taken out of the match on a stretcher early.  Thank goodness.  Sting takes a beating.  Standard routine.  Hogan comes out and leg drops Macho.  THREE times I think.  I loved it.Hogan gets major heat immediately after the heel turn.  He says he's forming a new world order of wrestling, but later in his promo calls it the new world organization of wrestling.  He mentions WWF quite a bit, but not by name.  Hall calls Mean Gene Scheme Gene, and Hogan calls Ted Turner Billionare Ted.  "Billionaire Ted promised me movie deals brother."  Hogan tells all the fans to stick it and all kinds of trash is thrown in the ring.  Schiavone sounds p.o.'ed.  Ha Ha.Historic and fun to watch.  Highly recommended.  Don't buy WCW's later garbage though. </p>
