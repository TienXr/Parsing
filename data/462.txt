 <p> This book was a fun read, firstly with the great photos of these weird and wonderful creatures, and then with a great explanation of what they were, where they lived and how they lived. The author has obviously taken great care with this book and this shows in how thoughtfully it has been put together. Thank you. </p>

 <p> What a fun way to teach your kids about the natural world. A short description of each animal helps kids learn, but it's the high quality photos that will interest them the most, at least if my kids are an example. </p>

 <p> This book contains a lot of amazing and interesting animals that I've never knew existed.  Some are weird looking but some are really beautiful to look at.  I had a great time looking at the pictures inside and discovering what these animals are.  Children will definitely enjoy this book and learn as well. </p>

 <p> Weird Animals my daughter loved it. I liked it. Never knew there were animals in the world that looked like that. Besides great pictures the book was informative on each species. If your child likes animals & weird things they'll like this book. A lot!. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Very Entertaining & Educational Animal Book </p>

 <p> Just purchased this book for my grandchildren and wanted to check it out first. I really just wanted to make sure that it was okay for them to have, but before I knew it, I had read every description and looked and all the pictures in the entire book. It is just that fascinating! The book has some really scary critters like the Tongue Eating Louse, a parasite that actually eats and eventually replaces its host's tongue and the Narwhale, which has a horn on its head that can get to be 9' long. 50 Weird Animals also features some deadly specimens like the Komodo Dragon, which can reach 10 ft. long and weigh up to 330 lbs., and the Pacu Fish, which the natives call the "ball cutter". The Pacu has been known to bite off and eat human appendages. Ouch!! Then there are the really cute creatures like the Angora rabbit, and my favorite, the Venezuelan Poodle moth, which looks like a tiny Poodle dog with wings and antennae.The only thing I could find wrong with the book was the photo didn't show the teeth of the Atlantic Wolfish also called the devil fish. The book says this fish has so many teeth that it can't close its mouth yet the picture does not show the teeth.If you are looking for a delightful, yet educational book to share with your children and grandchildren, this book fills the bill in every way. </p>
