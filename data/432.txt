 <p> A cute little book with fabulous illustrations! A good intro rhyme for each number with a repetitive invitation at the end of each stanza asking your little one to count the animals on the next page. Cleverly done... </p>

 <p> I love this book, especially the silly pictures. They are very bright and colorful, fun for little eyes to look at. The rhymes are also very cute. I especially liked how there was a question at the end of each section prompting the child to count how many animals are in each picture. Very nice! </p>

 <p> The images were really cute and my kids love dinosaurs but the story was just alright. Yes, there were things to count but not in an especially clever way. It similar to a lot of other counting books but could be a good fit for kids who love dinosaurs. </p>

 <p> Cute pictures okay story </p>

 <p> I have several of this author's books for children.  Each of them are educational and entertaining.  Smart rhyming and colorful pictures will delight your child, while teaching them how to count at the same time.  Highly recommended - my niece loved it! </p>

 <p> This is a really fun book! The rhymes are original and silly (I laughed as much if not more kiddos) and the pictures are REALLY great. The fact they practice counting is an added bonus. Totally worth buying. </p>

 <p> I allowed my grandson to choose the various books that he would like to read or have read to him and based on the cover of the book he thought it was about dinosaurs and not what it really was about. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This fun little rhyming book combines a child's love of animals with the process of learning to count. The playful verse associated with each number and animal type keeps the kids engaged, and encourages interaction, as they get to know the story each time they read it. Well done. </p>

 <p> This is a great book for kids just learning to count (e.g. numbers 1-10).For each number there's a "silly" rhyme that will engage the child and make him/her laugh.And the pictures are fun and a great way help the child reinforce their learning. </p>
