 <p> I have several of Kay de Silva's books in her "Our Amazing World Series" and have enjoyed learning new things about the various species.This book is filled with factoids about whales.  However, what makes this book are the captioned photos.  Most of the whales are shown up close and in detail.  I was intrigued by the picture showing Baleen whales as I never knew that some whales had comb like teeth.The book is set up to first tell some generic whale facts followed by photos and facts of individual whale species.  While I find the simple sentence structure a bit off and stilted, it would make it easier for a new reader to read on his own.It has a clickable Table of Contents.The format consists of a concept title, a photo and a small factoid paragraph.  The ratio between photo and sentence is about 4:1.I viewed this on a 17" screen using both the Kindle App for PC, the Cloud Viewer and an iPad with the following results:KINDLE FOR PC: the illustrations seem small for a children's book and cannot be enlarged (about 1/3 of a page). The concept title, photograph and factoid paragraph can be seen on one page.CLOUD READER: Even with the smallest font and the largest margin, I cannot get the title, photo and factoid paragraph on the same page. It usually took three pages per concept.iPAD: While reading the story the illustration fills about 1/4 of the page, however to see more all you need to do is tap the picture and it will enlarge to fill the entire screen.  When normal the title, photo and factoid paragraph are all on one page.I highly recommend this book.ETA: Add multiple format information. </p>

 <p> This is easily the most beautiful book I have ever seen on Kindle.  The pictures are amazing.But more importantly it is written with children in mind. My 8 year old had no issues reading and understanding everything that was written (I would think a 6 year old with a good reading level could read this book or most of it) and my 4 year old loved the pictures.Both boys asked if they could get the one on snakes or sharks next - what is it with boys lol?  But at least they didn't ask for spiders -much as I love my boys that would be a book Dad would have to buy.Nice to see a quality book and at this price you would be mad to miss out. </p>

 <p> I really did love this little book, as did my 3 yr old. The pictures were amazingly sharp and beautiful. The descriptions of the whales where brief, written with children in mind. My only complaint was that it was too short, only 10 pages long. When we got to the end even my 3 yr old said, "Is that it?", which is exactly what I was thinking. I would have liked it better if it was a little longer, say 20 pages, at least, but other than that it was very enjoyable. </p>

 <p> First off this is a beautifully illustrated book.  You can tell that the author loves whales.When my son came home with a 'Whale' project from school I was less than enthusiastic about buying him a book.  But I have no regrets with this one.What I also like is the fact that this book did not overwhelm him. He loved the pictures and the information about the Whales was in language that he could understand.  This is very important at his age, if he gets information overload from a book he will not go back to it.He has now read this one several times, and has been entertaining us at the dinner table with his new found knowldege, and some weird whale noises!A solid educational read and I will buy more in this series. </p>

 <p> Solid Educational Read </p>

 <p> This is a short, easy book for children to read or have read to them.  The text in the book is short enough to keep them interested and full of facts they will remember.  The pictures are beautiful and will keep them busy for hours!  Highly recommended. </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed the book and learned so much. Never realized that whales have hair on their bodies, or that the Bowhead whale can live over 200 years. So many interesting facts and beautiful pictures. Loved every page! I would give the book a 10, in my opinion, if I could. </p>
