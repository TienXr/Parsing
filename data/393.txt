<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Love and Friendship Formed Through Desperate Choices </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> 4-1/2 StarsTheresa Crawford never thought her ex-boyfriend, Max, would ever come seeking her physic help, especially since he had openly scoffed her abilities and clearly stated his belief that she was a fraud. But now Max's godson, Tommy, is missing and Max is desperate without any leads. Not only do we get to watch Theresa and Max reconnect, but we also get to watch the missing godson and one who is responsible.I really enjoyed "Desperate Choices." The writing flowed as the story progressed and moved from character to character. With the changing POV it wasn't a mystery as to what happened, but it created a highly suspenseful story knowing what everyone is doing but not knowing how it will all work out.The characters were very real and well fleshed out. By letting us into the minds of the characters, we come to understand them. Even the "bad guy" created sympathy for his cause even though he went about things in a horrific manner.  The magic aspect of the story was done very well and was finely interwoven into the story making it believable.I appreciated the romance in this book wasn't "lust at first sight" but rather a reconnecting of two people who have known each other for years.  The development of their romance was nicely done making it both believable and desirable.I was really moved by the theme throughout the story that good can still come out of bad situations and the bad choices of others.  Theresa is living proof of that--she suffered a tragedy in her teens but out of it a friendship was cemented with Remy, Max's younger brother. Not only did she gain a best friend, but it also led her to Max.  There's hope that with all that Tommy is suffering, some good will come out of it.  It is so much the opposite of blame.I highly recommend "Desperate Choices" for those looking for a well developed suspenseful story with fleshed out characters and a wonderful love story.**Received free copy from Net Galley in exchange for an honest review** </p>

 <p> Desperate Choices has everything a reader looks for...a compelling story line that won't let go, characters to root for, and a surprising ending that makes it the journey worthwhile. I love the touch of paranormal in this suspense. The romance was well done, as was the tension and the way it all came together. Desperate Choices is a winner! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A good but too short paranormal romance </p>

 <p> Once in a while you get that book that you find hard to review. It isn't because it is bad or overly strange, just hard to put your finger on what exactly you want to say about it. Desperate Choices was one of those books for me & I found myself really having to think hard about what I wanted to put in the review.A boy is missing, presumed a runaway by everyone except those who knew him. When his godfather Max needs help, he knows that there's one person he absolutely must go to- psychic Theresa Crawford. However it isn't as simple as asking for her help- there's a lot of tension between the two of them that is begging to be resolved ever since they last parted months ago. With time not being a luxury, the two of them must overcome their past issues in order to focus on rescuing Max's godson as well as a future that involves the two of them together.Like I said above, this was a hard book to review because I had to really think about what it was about the book that bugged me. This isn't a bad book & there are some strong features to it that readers will really enjoy, such as the wonderful passion that unfolds between Theresa & Max. Their love scenes were one of the best parts of the book. Theresa's psychic abilities were also very intriguing to read about, as was her past.But where the book fell short was ultimately due to its length. This is a short book, only being about 190 pages long. There's just too much story here for a novella & I felt like the story was a bit too condensed for this length & as a result, things happened just a little too fast. I wanted more detail about the characters, their past, as well as the villain's past & I couldn't help but feel that another 40-60 pages would have helped flesh everything out just that little bit more. I kept getting the feeling that I was missing out on some back story & wanting to see that little something more.Overall though, this was a decent book & I really do think that this will entice many readers of paranormal romance.(ARC provided by NetGalley) </p>

 <p> I am very impressed with Ms. Ivan's debut novel.  This story has it all - gut-wrenching suspense, a unique plot, romance and sensuality, and characters that you really feel for and root for. The story kept me engaged on every page. I can't wait to read more of Kathy Ivan's books! </p>

 <p> A fantastic debut that had me on the edge of my seat from the first page. You know a book that starts with an ex boyfriend asking the psychic heroine for help to find his missing godson is going to be a good one, and Ivan didn't disappoint. I can hardly wait for this author's next book. </p>

 <p> Wow! Just... WOW!Kathy Ivan just took me on an amazing ride with Desperate Choices.The story weaves you through the streets of New Orleans with a plot that unfolds into a tale of kidnapping, heartbreak, passion, murder and love.I applaud the author on her creation of every one of the amazing characters that came alive through her words on every page.  I was captivated from the description of the mouthwatering food of the south, to each step she takes you through, of the past of her leading lady, to the details of the investigation.I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who enjoys a passionate romance and a well thought out suspenseful plot. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Desperate Choices begins with a meeting of two people with a shared past - the tension boils just under the surface as our heroine, Theresa, closes the door to her Psychic shop and turns to face her best friend's older, hotter, brother - Max. As a reader, you know that something happened - and you cannot wait to find out what will eventually happen when these two collide for real.The pace is a tad slow at times - but the coupling of a simmering romance and a kidnapping mystery keeps the Reader guessing how it will turn out - and who will get caught up in the danger that surrounds these two.The chemistry between the two heroes is electric, the verbal arguments over the secrets they refuse to share with each other, the disbelief Max has for Theresa's psychic abilities and the rawness of their joint pain from hurts that were never communicated properly combine to create a cloud of tension that makes you eagerly flip to the next page, breath held to see what will happen next.The ending was a tad rushed, but it was sweet and perfect for these two.All in all, a great book - a compelling story and memorable characters! </p>

 <p> Theresa Crawford hates being psychic. In fact, until recently she tried to pretend the ability didn't exist. But when Max Lamoreaux came and asked her for help in finding his godson, she couldn't refuse. Theresa and Max had briefly dated a year ago but things never worked out. Now Max wants a second chance with Theresa. Can Theresa help Max find his missing godson? And can each of them face their past in order to have a future together?Kathy Ivan is a new author to me but I will absolutely be looking for more from her in the future. If I get really lucky she'll write a story for Max's brother Remy! Max and Theresa are both characters that make you anxiously want them to have their happy ending while the suspense adds just the right amount of angst to keep you turning the pages. I highly recommend Desperate Choices. Readers can't go wrong here!MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed </p>
