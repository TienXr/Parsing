<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I came away from this book unsatisfied. The author spent so much time talking about The Event that the romance passed her by. This book should have been better the back story about bleaching skin, missing children etc was great but the romance was so one sided, he fell in love he stalked no chased her. She was so slow with everything that the book ended without her. The reason why she got along with the girls so much was because she was one herself. I recommend this book only because some of the proceeds is going to a worthy cause otherwise... </p>

 <p> If you like a little substance to your stories, this book is worth your time.It's definitely a multicultural romance - bwam - Jamaican style.  The historical background, as well as, the cultural foods, land and people are interesting and does not inundate the romance developing.Loved the romance. Will look for more from this author. </p>

 <p> I get it the Event is the accident and the incident preceeding.  The total recall leads to Julissa facing her fears and conquering them.  More important is the worry about the opinions of people who do not matter influencing personal choices and behavior.  Julissa finds her joy in releasing her past, accepting the love of a sincere man and helping young girls fight silly social stigmas on a beautiful island.  I wished the Earl situation could have been dealt with earlier so romance between the gorgeuos Sebastian and Julissa could have more steam but over all good read. </p>

 <p> Romance with depth </p>

 <p> This was a sweet romance with some darker elements creating just the right balance. Julissa is a jazz singer who suffers emotional and physical scars following a traumatic car accident but can these all be attributed to the event? Part of our journey is to find out exactly what happened.She is adrift, stuck in a rut until an offer to sing at a Jamaican gig gives her the impetus to act independently and take charge of her life. The offer comes through a long-term admirer Sebastian who has harboured a major crush since watching Julissa sing. Sebastian sets out to win her heart when she comes to Jamaica & she is drawn to him but has a fianc&eacute; Earle to contend with.The story unfolds beautifully with mystery and tragedy thrown in to ginger things up a bit.The editing could have been better and I also felt some issues were unresolved for instance - did Julissa meet with Sebastian's ex-wife? How did Julissa's relationship with his kids and parents develop? Crucially, how did Julissa's own family react to her breakup with Earle & how did she explain the circumstances to them?I would have given 5 stars but for these issues but nonetheless this was a sweet and refreshing love story & I look forward to reading more of this author's books. </p>

 <p> I enjoyed reading Jamaica Dreaming. There was depth in the plot and the characters and you could not help but start planning your own trip to Jamaica in the hopes of meeting someone as steamy and romantic as the leading man. The author touches on many issues pertinent to life in Jamaica and also does a good job describing the Jamaican landscape. </p>

 <p> I loved it, well written not to my he to the story, but it was a nude read when I think about my last two flops, thus was light and airy, it was all so a cause, while they waited to fall in love. PS when they were making love she did tell him she loved him error on you writer, it's there! </p>

 <p> I devoured this well-written story in one sitting. Throw a scrumptious hero and a beautiful but deeply wounded heroine together on Bob Marley's island and those sparks ::will:: fly! Captivating setting, sizzling chemistry, true-to-life issues and a dash of mystery render this romance unputdownable. Recommended!Liane S. </p>

 <p> This was pretty good read, but there definitely was no heat in this book. I love the idea of the missing children and idea of  beauty base on the lightness of  one skin. . I think that why I started reading interracial romance because many of H was of darker complexion, where as  African American stories the H was always lighter complexion and the darker complexion women was always the villain. Ok that me going off on a rant. So back to the story it was a good read the story move a little slow . </p>

 <p> I loved the main characters of this book and I think the author did a good job with character development.  I loved the ups and downs that they had to face in their courtship and how Sebastain unrelenting pursuits help them to come together as a couple and each individual grew and evolved for the better.  Their journey was beautiful and I am so happy that I got a lot to read about the couple and the evolution of their love and the expansion of their family. It was an excellent well written series it is definitely one of my favorites. </p>
