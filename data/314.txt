 <p> If you are a first-time paper piecer, as I am, this is not the book for you.The book is pretty inside. It gives great ideas on how to change colors around, so the same pattern can look vastly different, just with the rearrangement of or choice of different colors.It's got patterns.  That's good.But for a first-time paper piercer, who is learning HOW to do it, this is not for you.First, the title tells me that this is about paper piecing, obviously.  So I would expect a review of, at the front of the book, what KIND of paper to use.  Go ahead.  Look through the book.  The whole book.  It's not there.  Not anywhere.  If I'm learning about how to do something, I want all of the items needed to do that project clearly and easily listed, at the beginning of the book, with explanations on what kind do I need, what size if appropriate, where am I most likely to find this item, and so on.  That's not in here.  If you're taking a class and using this book with the class, and the teacher tells you - that's great. If you pick up this book on your own, or try to review it before even getting to said quilting class - you're going to be in some trouble.  I got cold feet, though I went on the class and enjoyed it.Another big problem for me is that the book does not make clear that when you photocopy the patterns, you really need to photocopy more than one set of an image, if you are going to have more than one of those items in your pattern.  For example, if you are using one of the heart templates and plan to have 4 hearts in your quilt, and especially if you are learning how to do this for the first time - you need to make more than one copy of that particular pattern, because first time learners are probably going to have to take out stitches, re-stitch, and the paper eventually tears apart, in spite of multiple pieces of Scotch Tape.  :)  That's all part of learning, of course, but it would help to de-stress if we knew this upfront in the book.My biggest concern, though, is that as a beginner, I really want clear, step-by-step instructions on how to do paper-piecing.  The book doesn't have it.  There are some instructions, but then you are left hanging at what feels like the most crucial moment in a block.For example, in learning how to do one of the house templates, the book gave me instructions at the front of the book - nowhere near the actual house template itself - for only part of the template.  I got to the most difficult part, for a beginner at least, in which I was trying to piece together the window and part of the panel of the house and - no directions. Some black and white images, but I'm a beginner.  I need COMPLETE, step-by-step instructions.  I want to learn how to do this, and not have to have a class, or if I have a class and use this book, then be able to use this book as a reminder of what I learned in class on those evenings a week or two or a month later, when I'm trying to recall what to do.Here's what I would recommend:  all of the information in this book is good.  But it needs to be re-grouped in a more logical way.  Explain everyting that needs to be used in order to DO paper piecing, first.  Explain what kind of paper to use.  Tell us what kind of thread to use.  Give some examples.  Explain more clearly, in the first chapter, about photocopying the templates; that as beginners, we'll probably need to make several.  Many quilt class instructors assign this book and just tell students to go over the book, and "be ready" for the class.  You can't just "be ready" for a class only by reading this book.  It doesn't give enough information.  It makes assumption, big assumptions, on your knowledge.Re-group the remaining information.  For instance, start off with the heart template or an easy pattern.  Take it step-by-step.  Color pictures.  Take it from the very beginning and don't assume that we already know.  "Here is your fabric.  This is the wrong side of your fabric, see?  now place the WRONG SIDE of the fabric against the back of the template like this."  Make it simple.Group all of the heart templates together in the chapter about yes, heart templates.Then go to more complicated blocks, such as the houses.  Boy, you do NOT want to be sitting at home a week after your class, trying to figure out mid-way through a wall hanging sampler, how to teach yourself from this book how to do the house template.  Not unless you've got a lot of patience, time, and photocopies of that template.  And a really good seam ripper.  :)THEN give us examples and pictures in the back section of the book of different wall hangings and quilts.This is a pretty book, and hidden in it is some good information.  I think if it was rearranged a bit, and things made a little more simple, it would be a fantastic book.If you are an advanced paper piecer with a lot of experience and only want this for the templates, then this is a good book for you. </p>

 <p> And this book has a great assortment. The best part of the book however are the instructions.  I discovered short cuts or tips that make the process easier.  If the book had a flat layout (spiral binder), it would be easier to copy the patterns....but then the book would cost more. </p>
