 <p> The majority of the series' best episodes were during the Emma Peel years, 1965-67.  You have to give credit to this tape, then, for giving equal time to all of John Steed's delightful female co-fighters of crime, by picking episodes from the Cathy Gale and Tara King years that no one will deny are among the best The Avengers had to offer.For starters, "Look  -  Stop Me If You've Heard This One..." is simply the best episode ever made in the series' long run.  It has been argued that this brilliantly balanced crime melodrama/vaudeville act was an Emma Peel story filmed after its time, but if it was, then Linda Thorson's Tara King was well up to the task of pulling it off.  The script is low comedy as high camp, yet succeeds in achieving some genuinely horrific moments.  The performances all round are excellent, especially from guest stars Jimmy Jewel and Julian Chagrin as a killer clown and a murderous mime.The Cathy Gale episodes chosen are those that put Honor Blackman's talent to the fore.  "Mr. Teddy Bear" was the first genuinely bizarre story in the series, with Cathy going undercover to hire perhaps the world's best hit-man  -  with Steed as the target.  The master assassin's name derives from his birth name, "Edward Bruin," and his eccentric trademark of doing business through a remote-control robot teddy bear.  "Don't Look Behind You" is a superior piece of film noir, in which Cathy is lured into a sadistic death-trap by an escaped psychopath she helped put behind bars years before.  Later re-filmed with Diana Rigg as "The Joker," Blackman's version is actually much better, both for its excellent use of black-and-white light and shadow and for Blackman's genuinely terrified performance.The Emma Peel episodes are both from Diana Rigg's first year, "Death At Bargain Prices" and "Too Many Christmas Trees," the latter a well-known Avengers classic and one of its most sparkling scripts, and the former one of its cleverer and wittier suspense pieces.Anyone might quibble over whether these are truly the best of the series, but no one will contest that they are excellent episodes all, and well worth watching. </p>

 <p> The best. Doesn't seem to fit this classic espionage program. More like the greatest!!! The second-longest running spy show of the '60s (Mission: Impossible beat it by 10 episodes) had great acting, stories, music, fight scenes. Honor Blackman is my personal favorite out of the Avengers girls and my favorite out of the Cathy Gale episodes is Don't Look Behind You. A classic thriller that is enhanced by the black and white videotape. I love the build up to the reveal of the "diabolical mastermind" (The first episode of this set, Mr. Teddy Bear is the first to feature a villain of this nature), and, this is my opinion (and I mean all you Emma Peel fans), DLBY was better than the remake, The Joker. Mainly because, like I said, the black and white adds to the mystery quality of the show. For the two Emma Peel episodes, I wish one could've been in color but thems the breaks (Epic or The Winged Avenger would've been perfect). Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee complement each other in a way that it is easy to see why she is the most popular among the fans. From her episodes, I would pick Death at Bargain Prices, mainly because of the witty dialogue scenes between Steed and Emma. Tara King's episodes, while not my least favorite, seem to pale in comparison. While both are good, and it's not Linda Thorson's fault, they seem to lack any genuine threat that the other episodes had. If I had to pick, I'd say Look- (stop me) is my favorite because its a fun episode that ends in one of my favorite fight sequences. </p>

 <p> This is a great DVD collection. You get Patrick Macnee as the inimitable and urbane John Steed but of coarse. You get Honor Blackman as the lethal and worldly Cathy Gale. You get Diana Rigg as the sophisticated yet lethal Emma Peel. Last but not least you get Linda Thorson as the thinking woman Tara King. John Steed never had it so good. Perhaps you don't get the very best episodes. What is important is that you get a flavor for the series and how it evolved through the fast evolving decade of the 1960s. I think this is a very good collection. </p>

 <p> Poker faced John Steed certainly must have felt that he lived in a house of cards with the likes of the regal Kathy Gale, Mrs. Emma Peel and Tara King. `The Avengers" was a popular 1960's British fantasy-adventure series that focused on the exploits of a male-female duo in the service of the British government. The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed's first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed's new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event the series definitely left its mark amongst the finest. These DVD copies are gorgeous and they sound great in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono. </p>

 <p> I must say, I'm a big fan of the Avengers and Mrs. Peel rocks!! I'm a fan not only of Mrs. Peel but also of Diana Rigg. The show includes everything I like and when I saw the last episode with Mrs. Peel (the forget-me-knot) I shed a few tears, especially because Tara King was rather dull introduced in this episode and I thought: my goddness, that's Mrs. Peels replacement? But I was curious about these episodes and the more I saw the more I liked it! Alltogether I must say, that the Tara King episodes lack a little bit the fantasy and the crazy ideas from the Peel-era, but from the character, you can't compare those two women. Each of them has their virtues. Mrs. Peel is intelligent, brave, a fighter and very self-confident. Nothing could touch her! Tara is also a good fighter, funny, heartily and she worships Steed. It's a bit sad, that Tara King is talked down. Linda Thorson did a very good job, she made the Avengers a bit more human! </p>

 <p> The authors of the Avenger Series were excellent purveyors of great original ideas and these ideas were conveyed to the public on TV by a wonderful set of dedicated actors.I must confess that "The Best Of The Original Avengers" is really like an "Hors D'Oevres" where, once eaten, you are ready for another like course.  Personally, I was so impressed. </p>

 <p> This is a combo set from the show the Avengers with Patrick Macnee the one constant through out the series, The set has two of each of the ladies that starred with Macnee during the run of the series. First Cathy Gale these episodes show the early begginnings of the type of show that the Avengers would become. There is a lot of critisism of this time by some who do not see the difference in crude video taping and filming a series. i found these episodes with Honor Blackman to be very well done for those in studio bound days. Diana Rigg shines in her episodes and they are two of the best and show off how outrageous and fun the show became. Linda Thorson was the last but she was good at her role and was just put in to the bad luck of having to compete with the image of Emma Peel. Also Mother did not help the show. This is a compiplation of the show for us fans and a great set it is. </p>

 <p> This very reasonably-priced box set (six hours of entertainment for the usual price of one movie) is a bargain at any price. A&E; did its usual first class job of putting together this package.I won't dwell too much on the content of each episode since the other reviewers cover them in depth, except to say the Patrick Macnee did an excellent job of selecting two episodes each featuring each of his three female leads; Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg, and Linda Thorson. And, for a man his age, Patrick is still holding up quite well in the newly-videotaped segments.The extras in the package are a strong point, too. Patrick's overall introduction is worth the time to watch before watching any of the episodes. Also, he gives a short introduction to each episode. Some of his remarks seem candid such as his displeasure about the introduction of the "Mother" character in the last season in which he states that this took away some of the mystery and charm of the Avengers team by bringing out into the open the governmental spy organization in which they worked. Before, the Avengers seemed to be more like free agents loosely working within a hidden framework. "We would just show up," he said, "at the scene of a crime" and no one would question from where.Another extra, Linda Thorson's 15 minute promo film the box set called "Town Girl" (even though no title is shown on the film) does it's best to show Linda as a happy-go-lucky star on the rise. It appears to have been filmed after the Avengers series ended around 1969 or the early Seventies. The color is crisp and sharp and shows her running around the English countryside in tight blue jeans with dirt on the seat of her pants. Then there's a scene of her jumping into a swimming pool and trying to keep her head above water. It's all good clean fun.All in all, this is a great package from Honor Blackman's film noir episode "Don't Look Behind You" to Diana Rigg's quirky department store-turned-atomic bomb episode "Death At Bargain Prices" to Linda Thornson's wonderful "All Done With Mirrors."This set is a great place to start for anyone who is interested in the evolution of the Avengers or a person who has never heard of the Avengers or for even the die-hard Avengers fan. </p>
