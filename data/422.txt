 <p> A modern day Cinderella story where anything can happen in Paris, the city of love.Melanie Shaw is a young woman who is very independent, and even if her friends cancelled their trip to Paris, she's still going. However, she never thought that she would get robbed her first day in Paris. Aside from her passport, all of her belongings were in her bag, which meant no money and no phone. However, prince charming had her back when he went after the thieves. Maybe he would recover her belongings and save the day.Drew Eldridge had plans when he left his townhouse but the moment he laid eyes on a beautiful woman that looked so fascinated staring at the Notre Dame, he knew he needed to say hello. However, at that precise moment, two guys snatched her bag and ran off.  He tried his best in catching up with them but was unsuccessful. He offered her a room in his home, but she offered to pay her own way as soon as she got her money.Melanie is attracted to Drew but she knows they come from different worlds and he is just being a gentleman.  Drew knows he is attracted to Melanie and when she gives him a small peck of a kiss, he wants more.  When they finally fall into bed together, Drew knows that his whole world is about to change, but how is he going to convince Melanie of his feelings? Will Melanie be able to see past Drew's money and see that they are meant to be?ONE NIGHT WITH A BILLIONAIRE is a short read and very well written.  The storyline had me enthralled form the moment I started reading until the very end.  I liked Melanie and how simple and independent she was, how she was able to just let go and have fun. Drew was a very passionate, strong, protective man and I loved how he tried to make Melanie's experience in Paris the very best.  Drew and Melanie matched perfectly in every way; they had fun together and believe me, they devoured each other every chance they got.  The way Ms. Thompson described the heated moments, the darkness of their eyes when the passion was so intense, the way that they caressed each other, the way they explored their bodies was intense and hot.  I can't wait to read the second book in this series, Tempted by a Cowboy.If you are looking to read a quick, short, hot, spicy read, this is the perfect read for you.Reviewed by CozyReaderfor TheRomanceReviews.com </p>

 <p> Review for Ramblings From This Chick Blog. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comOne Night With A Billionaire is the first book I have read by Vicki Lewis Thompson. I really enjoyed reading this novella. It was short and sweet and everything I hope for when reading a contemporary romance. Melanie has dreamed of going to Paris and when her friends both bail on the trip, she decides to go anyways. Right after arriving she is mugged and loses her backpack containing her money, credit card and phone. A handsome stranger named Drew, attempts to get it back but is unable to catch the muggers. Seeing that she is obviously a tourist, he immediately offers to help her. By some crazy coincidence, Drew is also from Texas like Melanie and they immediately hit it off. Drew sees the hotel that she is supposed to stay in and offers to let her stay at his home. Even though Melanie is suspicious at first, she quickly sees that Drew means no harm and decides to stay with him and let him show her Paris. What starts out as a friendly companionship around the city, quickly becomes an attraction that neither one can or wants to fight.Drew is from an extremely well to do family from Dallas and has had every priviledge growing up. Now that he is an adult he has expanded upon the wealth he was born to. He knows instantly that Melanie is different from the women in his social circle, and that is part of what first appealed to him. I loved that he liked Melanie because she was her own person and refused to rely on others to help her when she could clearly take care of herself. It was nice to see that even though she wasn't rich and didn't have fancy clothes that he could see who she was beneath the surface. Melanie was strong and independent refusing to let a mugging ruin her trip. She was a really likeable character and I loved that she showed her wonder and awe of visiting Paris for the first time. It was so sweet how Drew would encourage her to experience everything like that because he got just as much enjoyment out of seeing it through her eyes as she did. Drew and Melanie were so sweet together and the growth of their relationship was very romantic.For me this book was like a dessert at the end of a meal. It was quick, light and fluffy and the perfectly sweet end to a day. I read this in one sitting as it was a short novella. Even though the story was a quick one, I really felt the connection between Drew and Melanie and found their story to be completely believable. I would give this book a try if you love short and sweet romances. I know I will be looking for more books to read from Vicki Lewis Thompson in the future, and I can't wait to check out the rest of the Perfect Man series featuring Melanie's two best friends!**ARC provided by Publisher** </p>

 <p> Melanie was in Paris despite her two best friends who were unable to make the trip. And so far the little she has seen of Paris has lived up to her expectations, that is until she is mugged and her backpack where her money, credit card and cell phone are stolen. Lucky for her she meets a hero that tries to chase down her mugger and then wants to help.Drew Eldridge is a very wealthy man who spends a lot of time in Paris for business. He just happens to be in the right place at right time to help a beautiful woman in distress.  He is unable to get her stolen items back however does help her with accommodations.  And the fact that they are from the same state and have a mutual acquaintance shows that it really is a small world sometimes.Melanie and Drew are instantly attracted to each other and spend several fun days seeing the many beautiful places in Paris.  Drew loves viewing Paris in a new light as Melanie is full of child-like wonder as she is seeing places she has always dreamed of in person.  And of course nothing says love like being in Paris.This is a nice romance, very sweet and light.  The two are attracted to each other and there is nothing that is stopping them including drama, they just gravitate toward each other and the next thing you know they are heading home to meet family and riding off in the sunset.  I liked that Drew was from Texas as was Melanie and that they had a common friend, Astrid.  I also liked that this story arc will continue featuring Melanie's friends Astrid and Val in their own novellas.Very enjoyable short romance.Received copy through publisher from NetGalley </p>

 <p> ONE NIGHT WITH A BILLIONAIRE is the first novella in Vickie Lewis Thompson's The Perfect Man series. Focusing on three friends from Texas, the first storyline finds Melanie Shaw, alone in the romantic city of Paris, France when her friends are unable to make the long awaited European vacation. Things go from bad to worse when Melanie finds herself the victim of a mugging and all of her money is now in the hands of a Parisian thief. Enter Drew -a fellow Texan; a billionaire; and Melanie's savior. Within a matter of a few minutes, Drew has come to Melanie's rescue, offers his home and car and planned out her Paris itinerary down to the last minute. Along the way, the couple will soon realize, that they have more in common than Paris and a Texas twang-they are perfect for each other in every way-almost too perfect. Drew likes to rescue people and things and Melanie is ripe for the rescuing.The story is a novella, therefore everything happens rather quickly-from a rescue by Drew to the final kiss-five days will pass and an entire lifetime of promises is vowed and a happily ever after. There is no angst; no mystery; no suspense and no conflict. There was nothing to propel the storyline forward. The writing is simple; the plotline is very predictable but it is the one-on-one conversations between Drew and Melanie that are difficult to accept-almost adolescent in context. I thought I was reading a story written by a teenage girl. The quality or perhaps the style of the writing was less than stellar.I am not sure how to describe my feelings about this particular book, but for all intents and purposes, I was disappointed. And as for the title, there was more than ONE night with a billionaire. In fact there were five nights with this particular billionaire, which made me curious as to the selection of the title. The sex scenes were romantic but again, the talk between the couple would have been best left off the pages. I was rather uncomfortable with their sex talk-it felt off; stilted; juvenile.Sadly, One Night With a Billionaire did not live up to my expectations, although I am not sure what I was expecting. But I know, this was not it. </p>

 <p> This is a sweet story of a Texas farmgirl who meets the man of her dreams on a vacation in Paris. Melanie ends up in Paris by herself after her two best friends have to bow out of their planned vacation. On her first day she gets mugged and a fellow Texan comes to her rescue.  Drew is a wealthy businessman who noticed Melanie even before her difficulties. The story revolves around Melanie's concerns that their lives are just too different for the relationship to work even though they have great chemistry.  Drew is convinced that he has found the woman for him and he is determined to get what he wants. It's fun to watch how the two of them work thing out.This is the first novella in a trilogy.  The second book Tempted by a Cowboy is due out in June. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This was a quick, sweet, and romantic read. There wasn't any drama or anything trying to keep the two apart, just a true love story. You have to believe in love at first sight to truly enjoy this one. Melanie and Drew only have four days together, but it is four days in Paris with no budget.  The sexual tension in the beginning is palpable and then when they do give into its hot and intense. Neither Drew nor Melanie have past issues to deal with, they have just found love where they didn't expect to.Overall this an enjoyably sweet read. I did enjoy Drew and Melanie's story, but I had a difficult time getting into it at first. I would've liked to connect to the characters more. I am interested in reading Astrid's story.I recommend this to anyone looking for true love without all the usual drama. This was a very refreshing break from all the angst that I seem to read these days.(Received copy from publisher for an honest review.) </p>
