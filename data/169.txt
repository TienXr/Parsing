<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Sharp and intense, `Le Jour se Leve' is a magnificent film from one of the very best years in cinema; 1939.  Staring the impressive Jean Gabin, the film centers around a man who has just committed a murder.  Locked in his apartment, this man (named Francois) contemplates the events that led him to such an act and the people he met along the way.  Gabin is sensational as Francois.  He had such an impressive look (he was very handsome and commanding in his presence), and Gabin was able to use his statuesque features to create an aura that consumed the audience.  He does so here as well, perfectly embodying the emotional complexities that slowly layer themselves upon Francois.  The script is tightly woven and delivers the intended chills and thrills and leaves the audience with an emotionally charged finale that will rest on your minds for some time after the close of the film.  Outside of the obvious plot point (the murder), there is intense character development here, beautifully composing people who are searching for fulfillment in places that elude them.  French cinema is certainly some of the best out there, and `Le Jour se Leve' is further proof to that claim! </p>

 <p> It begins with an argument behind closed doors, a gun shot, and then a man staggering out, falling down the stairs to his death. Behind the door is Jean Gabin, who now barricades himself in his room to keep the police at bay. We are then shown three flashbacks which explain how he got where he is now. Two of the flashbacks concern women he has loved, the third is about the sleazebucket Valentin (played by Jules Barry) who is also in love with one of them. It's Barry who comes to Gabin's apartment to get Gabin to stay away, and it's Barry who is shot by Gabin. (Barry is reminiscent of Clifton Webb in LAURA - the old lecher in love with a young beauty.) The composition of the film is poetic and beautiful, and the acting is very well done. The initial meeting between Gabin and his love Francoise in her house is exquisitely handled by both. It's a very romantic, stylish movie - a true classic in world cinema. </p>

 <p> There is always more beneath the surface of a Marcel Carne film.  It's all in the details such as the shots of a one-eared teddy bear in the attic reflecting the hurt of the man about to be terrorized by the police.  This movie - a precursor of film noir - begins almost at the end when an honest laborer, beaten down by the system, kills another man out of passion and has to hide in an attic until the police finally break down the door..at daybreak.  (French law provided that the police could not enter until dawn).  The story of the events leading to this dark ending is told in flashback. There is an eerie sense of dread everywhere. For example the hero (or shall I say anti-hero) works as a sandblaster in a factory and when he works, he is sealed in a cold suit of metal...all the while dark, demonic shadows abound or sulfurous fumes escape.  In the same scene, a flower girl arrives but loses the freshness of her plants because of the smoke.Made in 1939, the film is also a warning to France which was on the eve of war with Fascist Germany and itself holed itself up - in isolation - until the inevitable disaster.  (The Vichy government which collaborated with the Nazis forbade the showing of the film0.As in so many of the great Marcel Carne films, the director is obsessed with doomed love.  In those dark, edgy days leading up to the war, it must have seemed to Marcel Carne that happiness, while precious, is short lived - always on the verge of being snuffed out callously.I cannot fault the pitch perfect, sad performance of Jean Gabin. Watch his eyes as he awaits his inevitable doom.  Gabin - as Francois - portrays a sympathetic, bruised man. He loves an orphan perhaps because he himself was an orphan.Of all Marcel Carne films, "Le Jour se Leve" is his most compelling metaphor for the impending disaster awaiting France. Poetic realism indeed. </p>

 <p> Released less than three months before Hitler invaded Poland the fil is a real mirror image of the dominant atmosphere in those ages. Le jour se leve is a perfect example of artistic achievement , and the finest representation of Carne's poetic realism . The film is simply the poetic expression of the authentic human experience and one of the highest peaks in Carne's filmography .You can feel the struggling shadow of destiny surrounding the happiness' dream in every place you could imagine . The black atmosphere of disillusion and hopeless immersed in one the central nerves of the Civilzation is told with such of mesmerizing realism that clearly you will tie next films as Paisa or Roma open city with the social background but very close related in which lack of humanity and reason for living in the middle of the ashes .A classic! </p>

 <p> In 1952, "Sight and Sound" presented their first Top Ten poll of the best movies of all time.  Coming in a tie for 7th place was "Le Jour se Leve".  As the 20th Century drew to a close, movie fans were given a treat in the form of the book "The New York Times Guide to the 1000 Best Movies ever Made".  The book omitted movies from the silent era but was quite receptive to foreign-language films.  Yet the book did not list "Le Jour se Leve" as one of it's top 1000 films.  How does a movie go from top 10 to missing inclusion in the top 1000?  Perhaps "Le Jour se Leve" cam claim the title of being, simultaneously, the most over-rated and under-rated movie of all time.  Personally, I liked the movie when I saw it last night but I debated about giving it a 5 Star rating."Le Jour se Leve" is the story of a murder that strips away any semblance of suspense by giving the audience the victim and the murderer in the opening scene.  It doesn't take much longer to clarify the motive as well.  The movie's greatness is telling a love story within the context of our knowing its' extreme outcome from the start.  This approach gives the audience a unique focus on each and every step of the developing romances as the films goes through a number of flashbacks.  The main character is an easy-going laborer who stumbles into a relationship with a young woman.  There is another man and that leads to another woman all of which we pickup on in successive flashbacks.  There are a couple of minor twists that we don't see coming but the movie is very up-front with the plot."Le Jour se Leve" emerges into an intense romantic drama that develops the main characters in a method of excellance that was the likely reason for its' "Sight and Sound" Top Ten rating.  The characters are of varying complexity and the talented cast, led by Jean Gabin, is outstanding.  The direction by Marcel Carne is the key to the whole film.  I could not recall a scene that didn't add to the movie's impact.  This movie suffers from the key to its' own success; its' predictability.  Once I understood that, I was able to appreciate its' excellence but I can't fault anyone who thought otherwise.  "Le Jour se Leve" doesn't make my Top Ten but it certainly makes the top 1000 with plenty of room to spare. </p>

 <p> In the late '30s and early '40s, the films of Marcel Carn&eacute; gave eloquent voice to a mood of fatalistic, romantic pessimism... After the war, however, his career was a sad shadow of its former self...Central to Carn&eacute; and Pr&eacute;vert's conception of doomed love was Jean Gabin's proletarian antihero, trapped in darkened rooms and foggy streets while awaiting retribution for crimes he barely knew he might commit: in "Quai des Brumes," Gabin's deserter comes violently up against local gangsters in a battle over the girl with whom he has fallen suddenly, passionately in love; in "Le jour se L&eacute;ve," surrounded by police but unable to contemplate surrender, he recalls the events leading to his shooting of a girlfriend's seducer...Widely described as poetic realism, Carn&eacute;'s style is in fact anything but realist; the squalor, shadows, and smoky bars all externalize the hero's melancholy resignation to an unjust Destiny... Without Carn&eacute;'s expert control of atmosphere, the effect might seem merely picturesque, for rarely have solitude, alienation and death been imbued with such elegance and beauty... </p>

 <p> A complex tragedy that gives the impression of relentless, inevitable fate.  This impression is enhanced by the first moments of the film in which a man is killed and we see the killer 'holed up' in the same hotel room in which he shot his victim.  There are a series of flashbacks in which our protagonist, the killer [played sympathetically by Jean Gabin], reviews the events leading up to the murder.There is love, mendacity, disgust and bottomless jealousy.  The 'heavy', the murdered man, is truly reprehensible degenerate who adds young women to his score like a gun fighter puts notches on his gun.  Fate, uncontrolled temper and the police play their inevitable roles.  Francoise, our pitiful killer, is far more grieved about revelations about the girl he loved than he is about the killing, itself.Then again, what if Francoise acted impulsively on a disgusting lie? </p>

 <p> Carne's Craft, Gabin's Muscular Acting </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> "Le Jour Se Leve," ("Daybreak") (1939), a bleak black and white crime drama, romance/thriller, is considered one of the great classics of the French cinema.  It was directed by the legendary Marcel CarneChildren of Paradise ( Les Enfants du paradis )  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.0 Import - Australia]]] ); the original story was by the respected Jacques Viot; the script, by Jacques Prevert, with whom the greatest of French directors often worked.It stars the incomparable Jean Gabin (Grand Illusion - Criterion Collection) as foundry worker Francois, who kills the sleazy, sadistic, womanizing dog act performer Valentin (Jules Berry) to help the young florist he loves, Francoise, escape from Valentin's clutches.  Francois then retreats to his furnished room, reflecting on the events that drove him to murder, including his unromantic sexual affair with Valentin's former stage assistant, Clara, played by the ever-beauteous Arletty(Children of Paradise - Criterion Collection),  as he waits for the police to renew their assault on him at daybreak.Well, in outline, it does sound bleak, doesn't it, and the material is.  Yet, such is the magic of Carne's vision, and Gabin's muscular acting, that it is not tedious, though you might expect it would be.  Much of the tale is told in flashback, as Carne delivers a film of great lyrical beauty, widely considered a monument to the French between-the-wars film school of "poetic realism," though a lot of it looks more like German Expressionism to me.  It gives us a very accurate portrait of working class life as it was lived at the time:  Gabin as Francois humorously delivers several lines on the unhealthiness of the various factory environments in which he has worked: he knows very well that they kill their employees.  And Gabin was certainly one of the cinema world's greatest working class anti-heroes. He had just played one for Carne in the previous year onPort of Shadows - Criterion Collection, another bleak film, though not quite as bleak as this one that is even more famous than this one, then and now. Who was Gabin, if you don't know?  Of real Parisian working class origins, French cinema's precursor to Humphrey Bogart (although Bogart was of more patrician family),  Gabin played the quintessential soft-hearted tough guy  in many movies, perhaps his best-known today being the series of films made of Simenon's Inspector Maigret books.  A stunning film, 93 minutes long, and not a second wasted. </p>

 <p> Well-acted but plodding, uncreative glimpse at love quadrangle </p>

 <p> *** This review may contain spoilers ***Le Jour Se Leve was considered good enough by Hollywood to be remade into a Henry Fonda vehicle in the 1940s. It's also currently considered a classic by many film critics and appears on some of the top ten lists for best film of all time. From my perspective, it's just another one of those films that's gained a reputation and because everyone else says it's great, it must be! But looking at it objectively, the story not only plods along but fails to pay off.The film begins with Francois, a factory worker, who has barricaded himself in his rooming house after shooting a man. The police arrive and he fires bullets through the door which almost hit the unarmed officers standing outside. The police call for reinforcements and a standoff ensues. The rest of the film involves flashbacks which explain how the situation arose as well as flash forwards to the present, with Francois holed up in his apartment as the police take various actions to try and get him out.It seems that Francois has fallen for a young waif, a floral shop worker by the name of Francoise and courts her assiduously. After a few weeks, he wants to stay the night with her but she tells him she has another engagement in the evening. Francois follows Francoise to a nightclub where Valentin, an older man, is performing a dog training act. Francois spies Francoise as she goes through the stage door in the back of the club to visit Valentin. Meanwhile, Francois runs into Clara (played by Arletty who was blacklisted for awhile in the French film industry after having an affair with a German Officer during the Occupation in World War II). Clara, who is Valentin's assistant and lover, reveals that she's just broken up with him after a three year relationship.The rest of 'Le Jour' revolves around Francois shacking up with Clara but also seeing Francoise. Valentin confronts Francois continuously and at one point falsely claims that he's Francoise's father. Finally, Valentin comes over to see Francois with a gun and admits that his initial intent was to shoot him. After further angry conversation, Francois takes Valentin's gun and shoots and kills him with it.That's almost it. After all the flash forwards to Francois dodging police bullets fired into his apartment, he finally decides to shoot himself. After all the machinations amongst the quadrangle, the suicide is probably the most unimaginative way to conclude the story.Le Jour's characters are all rather one note. Francois is the probably the best of the bunch since he has that gift of gab with women. But he's also an obnoxious hothead who can't control his temper. After he shoots Valentin, are we really supposed to feel for sympathy for him? The shooting is completely uncalled for. As for Valentin, his wacky demands for Francois to stop seeing Francoise become tiresome. Yes we get it that he's insanely jealous but it would be nice if we found out some things about him. Francoise appears particularly spineless as she continues her relationship with Francois despite continuing to see Valentin. I couldn't understand what she saw in Valentin and it's never really explained. Perhaps she's 1939 France's answer to a 'flower child'. Finally, Clara is the most level-headed of the bunch. She garners sympathy at the end when she attends to Francoise after she faints as the police close in on Francois. But Clara's screen time is limited and seems to be the odd woman out in the drama.Le Jour is certainly well-acted and Jean Gabin is particularly good as the smooth-talking Lothario who seduces both women. But with all long-winded 'present day' scenes with Francois besieged by the police, unexplored motivations of the various principals, one note characterizations and that climax which ends in a whimper, Le Jour Se Leve is a decidedly overrated film, undeserving of inclusion in the pantheon of art house winners. </p>
