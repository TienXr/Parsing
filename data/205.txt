 <p> Franco Zefferelli's portrayal of each character to each of the young singers is as delightful to watch as the performance itself.  The singers absorb his mentoring, and perform admirably.  The four leading performers are superb.  I agree with one of the reviewers that Scott Piper out-performs Domingo.  Adina Aaron IS Aida, more passionate than the Met's Urmana.  Kate Aldrich is a super singer/actress.  She is such a pleasure to watch, thanks to DVD - beautiful and versatile.  She and Dolora Zajick are the best Amneris in the business.Do I miss the horses and the ballet?  With a performance like this, not really.If it wasn't for Amazon's review facilitation, I would not have known about this Aida.  I am grateful to the reviewers.  I shall purchase any opera by young performers directed by Zefferelli.  Hypothetically, given a choice of attending this performance, or the 2010 Aida at the Met, I go with Zefferelli.  The Met is slow.  Gelb should have already signed some of these young stars. </p>

 <p> I was originally attracted to opera by "grand" opera, and there is no grander opera than Verdi's "Aida".  For sheer opulence, you can't go wrong with the two Met productions currently available on Amazon (1989 & 2009), with SFO's 1981 production starring Pavarotti, or with Zeffirelli's La Scala version in 2006.  So I hesitated in buying this DVD with a relatively unknown cast, on a small stage, in Busseto, Verdi's hometown but still minor leagues in the world of opera. What ignorance on my part!  With ten Aidas in my collection, this is the one I go to when I want to experience the emotions Verdi's music is capable of eliciting.  Curiously, we owe most of the success of this production to Franco Zeffirelli, so associated with elaborate sets at La Scala and the Met, but who here, with more limited resources, has managed to mount an opera with just the right amount of spectacle - so as not to disappoint those of us who regard magnificent sets as part of the opera experience - but more importantly, has coached a cast of young singers into performing an extraordinary Aida.  Of all the Aida productions on the market, this one has the most believable cast: an Aida, Amneris, and Radames one can believe in as romantic leads. Other reviewers have gone into more detail, so I will not bore the reader with mere repetitions, but I do want to urge anyone looking for a good version of this popular opera not to hesitate in purchasing this one. </p>

 <p> This is like watching a film with actors instead of singers! That is how convincing Aldrich, Aaron and Piper are.  They all look their parts and act well and the production is amazing to the smallest detail.  The voices of these singers are to small to sing the roles under normal conditions, of course, but it really doesn't matter here: the house and orchestra are small, and the voices well caught in recording, so you can just turn the volume up on your TV and pretend it's a huge theatre :)  Kate Aldrich's Amneris is especially memorable.  This is really one of the best DVDs in my collection.  If you love this opera, don't think twice about getting it. In fact, the acting and production are so enthralling that even those new to opera will probably be riveted to the screen. </p>

 <p> Last night I kicked back to watch, for the first time, the much-talked about Aida from the Verdi Centenary Celebration in his hometown of Busseto.Franco Zeffirelli designed and directed and while he's so often accused (and often rightly so) of excess, the tiny 350 seat Busseto opera house, does simply not allow for big anything. The end result is that Zeffirelli seemed to take all of his creative power and infuse it into a spectacular small scale production where all of his big ideas shine through in his intense work with what has to be the youngest professional cast of any Aidaat any time in history.In some reviews Scott Piper is criticized as having too small a voice, but wow what he does with it. It's a beautiful (gorgeous) sound not unreminiscent to me of the young Pavarotti, sharing that same "sun of Italy" brightness that made the superstar'svoice so individualistic and well loved. His Celeste Aida is, quite simply, sung with such beauty of tone and attention to detail that I played it twice more before moving on. Handsome and boasting a sort of "Blacktino" heart throb appearance, his Radames is a very involved, physically appealing boy warriorcaught up in his own hype. It's a thoroughly moving idea and it works like a charm here.My new favorite YAM (Young American Mezzo) Kate Aldrich (a native Mainer!) is an Amneris of great physical and vocal beauty, and who throws a bit of 1920's silent film vamp into her gait that is amusing, appealing and not inappropriate here. Aldrich was only 26 with this Amneris but her sound belies herage with a rich, velvety chest voice that dips deepinto the lower range with astonishing ease.  In addition to her warm lower range, Aldrich also boasts top notes that are clear, ringing and rival the soprano's. An expressive actress, its nothing short of astonishing watching her pouty, spoilt-child Princess develop into a compassionate observer, awakened tothe brutality of her civilization. For once Amneris's shouts at the priests (paraphrased: You call yourselves ministers of heaven, but you feed on blood and slaughter) ring with a horrifying recognition that signifies the end of innocence.  The final image as with the temple priestesses she invokes the gods for peace, we've witnessed an entire journey of development andtransformation.  A truly remarkable performance.Adina Aaron has a lovely radiance, but, I found just a hint of blandness to her performance in the first and part of the second acts. (I realize just how difficult it is to look "forlorn" for so long - something that rarely comes without years of stage experience which this singer simply hasn't had the benefit of.)  She grows increasingly better with every appearance however,and in the Nile Scene she comes into her own blazing with an intensity and sensuality rare in any Aida. This Aida pours on a seduction I have never quite witnessed before in this opera (or, really, ever even thought about) and it works.  Radames is helpless as Aida sings, reaching into his already open tunic. Their kiss following "A noi duce fia l'amor" in the duet is not your typical opera stage kiss, but real. All of this, of course, would mean nothing if they couldn't carry it off musically andthe happy news here is the entire duet is ravishingly sung. The Italians loved it and applaud a good long while as the lovers grows more passionate and Aida's arm encircles and tightens around Radames' neck. Look out, hot stuff comin' through!The costumes and heavy ancient Egyptian eye make up make everyone look beautiful and as though they'd all just popped off of an ancient painting on a papyrus. Zeffirelli presents a lot of new fangled ideas with old fashioned gestures to create an Aida that is artistically stunning and dramatically resonates with a lot of what's going on in the world today. His cast - from top to bottom - is gorgeous to look at and a better acted Aida would be hard to find.The young Italian Maestro Massimiliano Stefanelli conducts with a brisk &eacute;lan that sweeps everything along wonderfully, crisp and fresh, yet knows when to linger over a phrase or extend the line for a singer having a "moment." He has a field day with the Triumphal Scene and the sound coming from both the tiny stage and the pit of the theatre is amazing!The whole thing (the sets really are an amazing achievement of old fashioned painted flat drops combined with 3-D set pieces that deceive the eye brilliantly) and works so well for the television screen that it almost feels made for it. I knew the theatre was small, but it's not until the entire company is lined up for a bow that one realizes how tiny the place is!It struck me at one point that the three principals of this most Italian of operas, were all young American singers, singing in an Italian house - and the Italians absoltuely loved them! Pretty sweet.  And pretty hopeful!This Aida goes straight to the top of the list! </p>

 <p> It's kind of a paradox: the biggest Verdi work staged in a mini opera house. As all reviewers do mention, the result is surprisingly good, and heavy cutting in second act is not a big drawback to this 2001 performance. By then, the main singers were very young (and also unknown), which is a major merit, rarely seen in opera: you see the plot characters played by people of the right age.The two ladies are indeed excellent. Beautiful Kate Aldrich wins first place for her total command of voice emission, acting and Italian phrasing. She delivers a fierce, passionate Amneris. Soprano Adina Aaron IS Aida: she looks like an Ethiopian princess, and she has everything else the role requires, though her Italian diction here is not quite perfect. The gents squad is also good, and my vote here goes to Enrico Iori, who plays a powerful Ramfis, sometimes a little too haste, but solid and promising overall. Scott Piper, a tender voiced Radames, has the right look and a beautiful instrument, but here and there he loses focus (and pitch) in this difficult role. He goes to falsetto in some high notes (Bergonzi's hand?), which may annoy some purists, yet he sounds fine and adequate to the small theater. In my opinion, his voice is better suited to Alfredo in Traviata, another Zeffirelli-Busseto production worth having.Maestro Stefanelli forces make the very small orchestra sound like a big one. There's Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS sound, picture format 4:3, subtitles in Spanish are so-so. As a bonus, "The making of Aida" is quite interesting: you can see Mr. Zeffirelli instructing the young artists about the different roles acting demands.  It's nearly 10 years now this DVD was recorded, and still is one the best Aidas around, though its small scale sets it in its own league. </p>

 <p> Had this thing typed then it went away.  Why am I doing it again?  Someone who read the insert said no one in it was over 21.  Looks it.  Beautiful faces and voices.  But am tired of it.  Children playing grown-up.  The king in gold standing with his arms bent holding two royal thingies for 2 hours like a cigar store Indian.  Just ordered the Domingo/Milnes version. Only reservations - Milnes is supposed to have been passed his prime (way passed), and how many shots will there be of Levine starring into the camera while he "conducts"?Everyone seems to love this production and so did I at first.  Small, condensed, colorful, big march happens off stage.  Oh.  It's on 2 discs (a real drag) in case you didn't notice.  I didn't.  Reminds me of R&H;'s "Babes in Arms" - on stage (which I didn't see), not the Garland/Rooney flick (which I did).It's playing now.  Have a 9" screen.  Perfect for it.  Someone called Zeffirelli a genius.  No sign of it in this.  Performed on a small stage (theater built for and in honor of Verdi I think), he made a virtue of necessity.  Costumes are out of this world."Celeste Aida" which opens it is indeed celestial - sung like an angel by a young beautiful plump chocolate tenor. </p>

 <p> After watching this excellent, exciting performance, I went to the booklet that accompanies the DVD to see who the performers were. Much to my surprise, I discovered that they were all in their mid-twenties when the opera was staged in 2001. In fact, it was the director and stage designer, Franco Zeffirelli who&quot;... organized the production as a workshop for talented young performers who are to be opera's future&quot;. The soloists received &quot;... intensive tuition [sic] in singing...&quot; from legendary tenor Carlo Bergonzi, arguably the best interpreter of Verdi's tenor roles in second half of the 20th century.The opera was staged as part of the commemorative of the 100th anniversary of Verdi's death in his home town of Busseto, in the tiny Teatro Giuseppe Verdi. When the opera opened with shots of a small stage and a small orchestra, I thought that I had made a mistake in buying this disc.I had not! The performance is totally captivating from beginning to end. Large scale Aida comes across very well in a small setting, where the focus is on character and not spectacle. Everything about this performance works splendidly to present Aida in a way that I had not experienced before.And these &quot;talented young performers&quot;? How did they manage the very demanding vocal roles? Like seasoned professionals! Adina Aaron carries the title role with near perfection, and my most memorable Aida was Leontyne Price! Aaron not only sings beautifully, from her first note to her last, with no sign of strain or fatigue, but she can really act. Kate Aldrich nearly steals the show as Amneris, the daughter of the King: she is beautiful and sings with incredible sensitivity, suppleness and perfect technique -- and she, too, can act. Tenor Scott Piper sings the role of Radames with great elan; his spinto voice is a bit lighter than some of the dramatic tenors who sing this role, but it is a fresh, lyrical voice that never tires or strains. Bergonzi's mentoring was demonstrated very well indeed, in Mr. Piper's case. Baritone Giuseppe Garra sings the role of Amonasro with total conviction and with fantastic voice. Conductor Massimiliano Stefanelli conducts with authority and sensitivity;  he observes all of Verdi's dynamic markings, thus making the intimacy of this performance very immediate.The disc quality is first rate, with great digital picture, and sound that can be played in the DTS mode, for a fantastic sonic experience. TDK Mediactive has issued several operas lately, and all that I have seen are simply wonderful, without exception. They use European productions, where expectations of operatic excellence are high.When I purchased this disc, I was looking for a well sung, authoritive, recent performance, without the vocally very tired presence of Domingo or Pavarotti. I was looking for a combination of authentic Verdi combined with outstanding picture and sound qualities. I found them.If you are looking for a fresh yet well performed version of one of opera's fundamental works, you cannot do much better than this. </p>

 <p> This is one the BEST performances of Aida that I have ever heard.  The singers are the best, the set is absolutely the MOST BEAUTIFUL  I have ever seen.  It is a top quality performance given in a 350-seat opera house and it works!  Missing is the ballet and the actual witnessing of the triumphal prossession which happens behind the singers.  However, the performance is so marvelous that this small omission doesn't matter. This is a recording that every opera lover should have in their collection; I have never enjoyed Aida more. </p>

 <p> Aida is an opera which has always been presented on the grand scale,  and here we have a completely different approach to this massive work.  It's been made very intimate and very immediate.  This has a positive effect on the drama itself, and it certainly gives a better opportunity to concentrate on the actual drama of Aida, Rhadames and Amneris.  The camera close-ups of the singers are especially helpful in this respect, and since all the lead singers are young and beautiful, this is really nice to watch.  The sets are beautiful, though they too are scaled for the smaller stage utilized here.  Overall, this is a wonderful way to experience "Aida", one that many will watch again and again.The only caveat is that the opera is presented with some rather noticeable cuts --------- which are immediately obvious to anyone who knows the opera well.  Were the opera presented in it's complete form, it would be worthy of a 5 star rating.  The singing is excellent, considering the ages of the respective singers.  No -- they do not approach the sheer power, volume and impact that seasoned operatic legends have lavished on this music, but they are quite good, and in a small theatre such as this one, their performances work well, as none of their voices are very large.The production is very beautiful, and the orchestra plays the music beautifully.  It's an outstanding way to introduce someone to "Aida" , but also an excellent way for an opera "veteran" to see this opera performed in a very unique and interesting manner. </p>

 <p> 'Very Good interpretation'This is the comment I have been receiving from those who saw this Opera, live.The DVD is not different.As far as I am concerned it has been able to provide proper appreciation of the creative work of such dramatic presentations set to music.Aida, Opera of grandiose libretto and refined orchestra (The Grand March and Ballet), was supposed to see its premier in Cairo in 1869.Ismail Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, was the father eternal of the Grand Opera-House of Cairo.The Pasha aimed at excelling Western cultures as art paramour and he asked Verdi to write an opera to be a masterpiece for posterity and take perpetual patriotic touches on the opening of the Cairo Opera House in 1869. (Not the opening of the Suez Canal as many believe so)Eventually it had premiered in December 1871 due to the Franco-Prussian war, which created difficulties to transport the costumes and related paraphernalia from Paris to Egypt. The Acts scenes are at Memphis, the capital of ancient Egypt, and require large number of players, Priests, Egyptian populace, Ethiopians prisoners of war, slaves, guards and soldiers and a spacious stage.I wonder how the people in charge of any theatre should be able to provide the necessary accommodations. </p>

 <p> This tremendous Zeffirelli production of Aida from the Busseto Theater is the only film of this opera I think I will watch over and over again.  Zeffirelli's touch of glamor is there but it's so wonderfully executed on a small scale that it puts to bed all the old nasty chestnut criticisms opera taste-arbiters have launched at `Frego' over the years;  overblown, Hollywood, Technicolor, DeMille, all are words that Zeffirelli has had hurled at his head like rotten tomatoes by the Regietheater crowd and other self-absorbed egomaniacs.  I call it jealousy, and Zeffirelli has really trumped  all those enfants-terrible this time with a stunning, imaginative and pragmatic Aida production, designed and directed by him.  His sets are extremely beautiful and subtle, his direction masterful.Act I begins with a very fine rendition of Celeste Aida by Scott Piper.  He looks like an Egyptian prince and he doesn't bellow or ham it up.  The voice is big enough for the small Busseto theater but it might not be a role for him at The Met, yet.  You can discern Carlo Bergonzi's coaching of his performance.  Legato, piano, pianissimo, ardent and youthful all accurately describe Piper's performance, like Bergonzi in his young prime.  He is currently singing roles like Don Jos&eacute; and Pinkerton so we may not have to wait too much longer for his arrival at The Met or Lyric Opera.Kate Aldrich is a beautiful Gloria Swanson look-a-like who also happens to have a powerful, rich mezzo-soprano voice.  Her Amneris is a young girl, sexually awakened and acutely receptive to sudden changes in the atmosphere, as when she spots Radames ogling Aida.  Her acting is very subtle and she benefits from the small, close-up stage as her facial expressions are apt and myriad in variety.  Aldrich has gone from strength to strength in her career and is singing Strauss and Verdi all over the place these days.  She is perhaps the most effective Amneris I've seen on stage, and she's well up there in terms of vocal performance in a role that is usually roared out by stentorian mezzo-sopranos.  Aldrich is powerful without being at all bombastic, though I suspect she's capable of flaking the plaster off the putti in the largest opera house.Adina Aaron is one of Zeffirelli's mystical creations.  Where did he find this woman who was, as evidenced in her performance, born to sing Aida.  It isn't just because she's a beautiful African-American soprano, she is a tremendous actress and possesses a luscious, imminently listenable lirico-spinto soprano.  She sings beautifully a role we are used to hearing by large-voiced, overdressed divas with lots of upper body strength, who can't act for beans but can bellow and swoon like there's no tomorrow.  Ms. Aaron's performance is the uncanny embodiment of Aida.  She looks like an Ethiopian slave, bare-footed and wearing simple Sari-like costumes and scarves.  There are recordings and films of greater sopranos in this role, but not many.For instance, Aaron's performance of Ritorna vincitor! is deeply moving and a rich slice of live theater I have never experienced so vividly in any other video of any opera.  There is nothing fake or grand-gesture about this production on the whole and Ms Aaron conveys the deepest connection with her personification of this well-trodden role.  Unforgettable.Aaron is currently singing some of the heavier Verdi roles in smaller European houses, roles like Aida and Leonora in Il trovatore and Elisabetta di Valois.Act I of Aida ends with the ceremony in the Temple of Vulcan in Memphis.  This is one of those scenes that are usually so bloated with extras, corps de ballet and obfuscated by clouds of dry ice you can't really figure out, or care, what, exactly these priests and priestesses are trying to invoke.  It's usually all razzle dazzle mystic hokum.  In this production the solemnity of the invocation is real and moving.  The chorus of priests is seated, no choristers are allowed to over-emote or attempt to act as they do at The Met (famous hams), and enunciates the words like I've never heard them before, pianissimo!, unheard of in Aida, in the theater anyway.  Luc Buoy's choreography for the five priestesses is beautiful and evocative, glorified by Anna Anni's sublime and historically accurate costumes.  Vinicio Cheli's lighting is of the highest order of imaginative beauty and aptness.  Never too dark, or murky, and bright and golden when it needs to be.I have to mention the opening of Act 3, before the Temple of Isis.  I got the sense that Verdi must have had a whale of a time composing this scene and the subsequent O Patria mia. The music he composed for Aida is really astonishing.I heard the birth noises of Sibelius in Act 3 and other surprising revelations in this performance.  We've gotten so used to it as performed by The Met and Covent Garden and everywhere else as simply cirque du soleil bombast and Wagnerian singers trying to trill and toss off rippling grace notes when it is clearly beyond them.In Act 3 scene 1 Kate Aldrich becomes incandescent.  Her voice in this mysterious scene is quiet, rich and potent, like few of those other roaring mezzos can accomplish after screaming through the end of Act 2.  Aldrich moves like a trained dancer, veiled in moonlight white and moving like an egret, elegantly in a temple pool.  It's very beautiful to behold.  This magical scene is followed by just about the most moving performance of O Patria Mia I've ever heard.  Adina Aaron's performance of this over-exposed but great aria packs quite an emotional wallop.  This singer has the goods and she does not suffer, at all,  in comparison to any of the great voices who have sung Aida.Scott Piper turns out to be a great Radames.  The Love Duet at the end of Act 3 is magnificently done by he and Aaron.Kate Aldrich surpasses herself in her big scene in Act 4, scene 1, confronting Radames and post verdict of Traditor!She has transformed herself into a black sequined gown femme fatal.  Her closing lines of the opera are powerful and the lighting is sensational for the final tableau.The supporting roles  are very well done.  Giuseppe Garra is especially impressive as Amonasro.These young singers are beautifully directed by Zeffirelli, and coached by Carlo Bergonzi, and can act and are very attractive to look at.  These assets are an unbeatable recipe for something unique, and Zeffirelli's intimate (but grand at the same time) production of Aida soars to the top of the filmed Aida pile.Massimiliano Stefanelli's conducting is so good as to draw no undue attention to itself other than from time to time causing me to notice how beautifully his small orchestra is playing and how right the whole thing sounds in his hands.  The camerawork is so excellent I didn't even notice it.  The sound is great, and the picture beautifully clear.TDKs presentation is good, a good quality plastic folding sleeve, very thin with 2 dvds, but there is nothing but barebones information.  There is an interesting feature on the making of this film.  There are optional subtitles in English and the translation is beautifully done, nothing risible or nonsensical.The only other Aida film I have payed money to own is the Robert Wilson production from Brussels in 2005, conducted by Kazushi Ono.  I have yet to finish Act 1 and I've owned that dvd for almost a year.  It is interesting and lovely to behold but....BORING, with absolutely no human emotional connection at all.  And the cast is not nearly as involved or involving as they were in Busseto in 2001.This Aida here ... is The One, like Muti's Falstaff also from the Teatro Verdi in Busseto, Italy.  I hope these dvd producers of opera videos continue to give us more superlative productions from this splendid venue. </p>

 <p> I agree with the earlier reviewer's five star assessment of this production.  What a joy to hear and see an "Aida" in which the singers (coached by Carlo Bergonzi!) are young and excellent, both vocally and dramatically, and who are allowed to sing in an opera house small enough to honor the human voice - and in Verdi's hometown, at that.  This "Aida" focuses upon the relationships among the various characters of the story and not upon spectacle. The sets and costumes are stunningly beautiful in any case, but they serve to support the action and the development of the characters.  I have never before been so profoundly moved by a performance of this opera in my 50 years of listening and watching.It sould be noted that this production omits the ballet in the midst of the triumphal march - and in this case it matters not a bit.  The earlier dance of the priestesses and the vesting of Radames is conceived as religous ritual that evokes a sense of awe, fearful awe.Everything about this DVD makes it a worthwhile purchase, very much including the documentary of "The Making of Aida," in which we see Franco Zeffirelli working with the young singers scene by scene, encouraging them to live into their characters and honoring the phyisical support required by their voices.  The conductor (Massimiliano Stefanelli) and the lead singers (Adina Aaron, Kate Alrich, Scott Piper) may not be known to the viewer before seeing this DVD, but once one has seen it one is on the watch for other recordings by any of them.I did an immeidate comparison of this production on DVD with that of the MET on DVD.  The young Scott Piper out-sings and out-acts Placido Domingo.  Piper even follows the composer's instructions for a soft tenderness at the close of "celeste Aida," whereas Domingo indulges in the "traditioanl" extended vocal trumpet call.  Domingo is a great singer and a fine actor, but young Scott Piper IS Ramades.  I can say pretty much the same down the line about each of the singers in the two productions:  Bergonzi's singers are at home in their characters, vocally and physically, whereas the MET stars are (beautifully) singing "opera" to grand "effect."  The MET DVD does include all of the ballet music, and the production and performance are overall very fine - don't get me wrong.  But I think I will return to the young singers in this venerable and small Italian opera house whenever I want to experience what my gut tells me is closer to Verdi's intentions. </p>

 <p> This is a lovely production, intimate rather than stupendous. The sets, costumes, direction.... okay, the orchestra isn't the Met's, the singers are not seasoned, but altogether, this bunch makes an Aida better than the Met video with Domingo and Millo. I missed the elephants in that one, but I didn't even miss the horses in this one. Moreoever, the horses and chariots in the Met performance were the same, merely going round and round.LOLWhat was touching was that no one was singled out for curtain calls, the cast, et al. appearing as a group. There was one stand-out singer, Kate Aldrich, who sang Amneris. Scott Piper's Radames and Adina Aaron's Aida just couldn't really compare with the the gloriouis voice of Aldrich. Scott and Aaron will grow, but I doubt they'll ever make it into celebrated singers.Interestingly enough, those three are Americans -- what? -- Bergonzi couldn't find any Italians? Never mind, this is a wonderful experience and I gave it five stars because it was the little engine that did.Nancy Eckert </p>

 <p> To commemorate the 100th anniversary of Giuseppe Verdi's death, Franco Zeffirelli organized this performance of "Aida" as a workshop for young performers. The opera is staged in Verdi's hometown of Busetto at the small 350 seat Teatro Giuseppe Verdi. This set of two DVD's is worth owning just to see the 45 minute documentary feature in which we are flies on the wall at the master classes conducted by Zeffirelli for the young soloists who were selected after an international audition.The great Verdi tenor from the 1950's, Carlo Bergonzi, serves as their vocal coach. Zeffirelli is their stage director and works with them on character interpretation and development. We're not used to seeing singers in their early 20's perform the roles of Radames, Amneris, and Aida. Zeffirelli challenges them (and us) to think about the characters in a new way - as young people, who, for the first time are  exploring love, witnessing the cruelty of the world, facing the decision of whether to choose another over oneself. (Aida and Amneris both must face this choice and, as we know, follow different paths.)Zeffirelli talks about each character in detail as the performers, in street clothes and in a small rehearsal room, practice their arias just inches in front of him. For example, Zeffirelli tells Kate Aldrich that she is not to play Amneris as the femme fatale we're used to seeing, but instead should think of her as a young, inexperienced girl of privilege who is used to getting her way and has no idea that her impulsive actions could have such tragic real-life consequences. The result of Zeffirelli's work with these young performers is that we see this familiar opera through new eyes.The performance of the opera itself is captivating. In one of the master classes, when Zeffirelli begins to talk about the Triumphal March, he says (with a twinkle in his eye), "They're going to expect elephants, but they won't get them." No we won't. An adult elephant would fill the entire stage, leaving no room for the performers! The full impact of the small size of the stage isn't apparent until the camera pulls back during the curtain call and we see that the stage isn't even a rectangle. It's a square. It's smaller than the stage that sat at one end of my junior high school gym!Can Grand Opera work on such a small stage? Yes. It works because, as I've indicated, Zeffirelli focuses on the characters, not the spectacle. For example, the Triumphal March takes place off stage. The performers turn their backs to us and, along with them, we must imagine the procession going past as we listen to Verdi's magnificent score. Only Aida faces us, sharing the pain she's experiencing at knowing that her own people are being marched by as prisoners.If this performance were on CD, you'd probably chose another version - one with Placido Domingo, Leontyne Price, Dolora Zajick...the list of great performers who played the three leads is a long one. Adina Aaron, who plays Aida in this production, says in the documentary, "Who knows? Maybe it will open the door to our careers or maybe it will just mean that we can say to people that we've worked with one of the great directors of all time." Well, I googled the names of the three leads (who happen to all be American). It appears that they've yet to make it to The Met. They're playing at the Dayton Opera, the Utah Opera, the Michigan Opera. So, yes, the voices on this DVD aren't always as great as those we're used to hearing. But what makes this DVD so special is that these young performers are able to realize Zeffirelli's vision and give us the gift of Grand Opera in an intimate setting.At the end of the documentary, Zeffirelli says, "The chance to work with young artists was what seduced me into doing this. It was like a flight of doves. They came from all over the world like doves called by desire." You too will be seduced by these young, earnest, talented performers. </p>
