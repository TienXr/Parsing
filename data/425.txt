 <p> Had to read Seer before I could attack Adept.  Very good series ... although I'm only about a 3rd of the way through Adept I'm hoping the story-line will continue with more volumes. </p>

 <p> This whole series is great. The reader gets to 'grow up' with the Taelaerin twins and share in their adventure. After I read the first book, 'Chosen&#34;, I immediately bought the whole series. Only to find that the last two have yet to be written!! AAARRRGGGHH!!.This series is so good that I read them all back-to-back.10 stars, Jolea!! Thanks! </p>

 <p> Another awesome installment in the Guardians of the Word - epic fantasy. Just when you think the author has run out of surprises -Wham!! There goes another one. I wait with great anticipation to see what is in store for me, the reader, in ADEPT, the Seventh Chronical of eight. I have trouble doing anything else until I have finished the latest story in the series.Excellent writing and a very special talent for adult epic fantasy - science fiction amalgam story telling.Thank you for your dedication to superior editing as well as awesome entertainment. </p>

 <p> This is the 6th in a planned series of 8 segments for a larger story line set in a fictional world of space travel, planetary kingdoms, mystics, spirits and telepaths, where the struggle, unbeknownst to the majority of non-telepaths, is to break a 1000-year cycle driven by otherworldly forces of evil and destruction bent on enslaving and wreaking ruin on the populations of the multiple worlds (not to mention there are beings from another galaxy, only obliquely introduced into the series at this point, who may or may not be hostile).  The writing is engaging, although a bit careless at times, and I found the story line to be a good distraction when on those long airplane rides.  I picked up the first of the series for my Kindle, out of curiosity and quite frankly because it was free, and have continued with the series because the overall story makes for a good read.  Across the 6 books in the series to date, I found the plot progression at times to be a bit tedious and sometimes the various characters' ramblings to be annoying, but the author always recovered by picking up the pace and more than a few times has either killed off or otherwise taken major characters out of action.  At least she has been steadily advancing the plot rather than indulging in obliquely related secondary stories, a common tactic used in similar series to stretch them out.  As might be expected for a segment of a serialized saga, this book concludes with a modicum of redemption and an objective achieved, but with troubled waters still ahead for the protagonists (the telepathic prince Dynan, albeit painfully, is finally able to claim the throne wrongfully denied him early on in the series and the evil Maralt neutralized, or is he?).  There are, after all, two story segments yet to go for these folks to win the larger battle of good vs. evil. </p>

 <p> From boys to men and all the responsibility that comes with power. From Prince to a King. Brothers together to right the wrong for their families and their kingdom. Thoroughly entertained from the first book to the next in this series. MUST READ. </p>

 <p> Absolutely brilliant!  I could hardly get my breath the whole way through there were so many ups and downs, twists and turns and the unexpected.I can't say too much so as not to give away the plot, but wow, this series just gets better and better.  It's full of battles on many levels, adventure, mystery and surprises.Highly recommended as is the rest of the series.  I'm already reading Adept, the next installment. </p>

 <p> Book Info: Genre: Science FantasyReading Level: Older Young Adults (16+)Recommended for: Those who enjoy darker storiesTrigger Warnings: Rape, murderMy Thoughts: It's been a long, hard road, but it feels like things are heading for the finish line in this, book 6 of the Guardians of the Word series. Which would be a mistaken idea, since there are still two books to go before this series ends. The amazing thing to me is how much the author has crammed in, and continues to cram into these books. There is so much going on that it doesn't feel like this much time has gone by!I continue to be frustrated by the unstoppable evil that permeates this series. This is not made easy for the heroes of the piece, as I've mentioned in other reviews. But I also continue to be impressed by the level of detail that the author works into this series, and how she manages to keep it all straight. We're starting to curve back around to things that started in the early part of the series and were seemingly put on hold for the Maralt cycle; those things were not forgotten, and we're coming back to them by the end of this book. I'm definitely looking forward to what the next two books have to give. If you like darker fantasy/science fiction, then you'll enjoy these books, but definitely start from the beginning; this is not a series where you can start in the middle without ending up hopelessly lost.Series Information: Seer is the 6th book in the Guardians of the Word series.Book 1: Chosen, released in 2011, reviewed August 2011, review linked here where formatting allowed.Book 2: Myth, released 2011, reviewed August 2012, review linked here where formatting allowed.Book 3: Telepath, released 2012, reviewed August 2012, review linked here where formatting allowed.Book 4: Legend, released 2012, reviewed August 2012, review linked here where formatting allowed.Book 5: Union, released 2012, reviewed August 2012, review linked here where formatting allowed.Book 7: Adept, released 2012, to be reviewedBook 8: King, to be released March 22, 2013, to be reviewedPlease note: On March 18, I'll be holding a giveaway on my blog for all 8 books, plus a grand-prize winner will also receive a $25 gift certificate. So watch for that!Disclosure: I received a copy of this e-book from the author in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.Synopsis: Bodies lie strewn on the Throne Room floor. The blood of the dead and the dying pools on black marble. Seeping down through the merest cracks in the floor, one fatal drop touches the Sacred Seal. A hole in the fabric of time opens. The Demon's Horde waits on the other side.It is the Seer's vision and her visions are never wrong. Only Carryn Adaeryn can stop it from coming true. It is her brother, mocking her, telling her she will fail at every turn. And she is terrified Maralt is right. Every tenet she holds close will be tested. Every truth is bent. The souls of the lost and the living can survive only if she doesn't fail. All the long years of struggle are in peril. No one is safe.When the rules change, nothing is certain. Action and reaction determine Carryn's choices and alter the course of time. The massacre is nearly complete. The battle for survival goes on. There's only one other who can face the terrible truth. Chosen by attrition.Can he hold the battle lines? Or will he succumb to the overwhelming allure of absolute power. Will he finally defeat his fear or will evil take his soul? There's no one to guide him, and the path ahead is littered with deceit and deception and death. Somehow, Marc Talryn has to find a way to save them all.It isn't so easy to kill a telepath. Or contain him. </p>

 <p> I fell in love with this series after reading the first book Chosen. The author has done a good job keeping my interest because there is a new twist in every book. They are very descriptive books that make you feel like you are part of the action. I already can't wait for the next book. I am a really big fan of  the Twilight and Hunger Games series and I think this series rates right up there with those books. </p>
