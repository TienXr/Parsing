 <p> Belial returns & this time he ain't alone. Duane Bradley & deformed brother are taken in by a family of "Special Individuals" as Granny Ruth calls 'em.Problems arise when a tabloid reporter and her sleazy (friend) photographer endanger their home.The sex scene with Belial & Wife is disgusting, yes.Get it only if you like low budget, frothy fun/horror films. </p>

 <p> Picking up where BASKET CASE left off, BC2 has the twins (Duane and Belial) saved by Granny Ruth, and introduced to a whole slew of freaky friends in her sanctuary for "unique individuals". Part two is not as gory, and has a lighter feel to it; that is, up until the final, gooshy third! Henenlotter is a cult film mastermind w/ a wonderful sense of the bizarre. He puts unusual characters in weird situations, while making them quite sympathetic. BC2 showcases this ability... </p>

 <p> Basket Case 2 is an excellent follow-up to the first, It has some very funny and original moments such as the Belial love scene. The film has a diffrent feel than the first but it turned out very nicely, The story is that Duane and Belial survived the fall at the end of part one and up being picked up by an old woman who takes care of people like them at her home. She takes them there and they become a part of the community of deformed people, A nosy reporter figures them out and they have to deal with her in their own way.A must own for those that bought the original. And for those that can manage to get ahold of the 3 one.Will Belial Find True Love? </p>

 <p> TWO WORDS!!!UNTAPPED GENIUS!!!!Part Lewis, part Argento, part Cronenberg, and part Jackson.It's a wonder that directors like Peter Jackson, & Sam Raimi, who produced similar movies, became HUGE!,while Frank Henenlotter who produced 5, count 'em 5, excellent bizarro horror comedies, faded into cinematic obscurity.The man is untapped genius!!!Someone needs to tell Hollywood to get it together!!Everyone knows how much the other 2 made them.That being said....This film is without a doubt, Frank Henenlotters crowning achievement.A better example of his work... does not exist.The screen explodes with more grisly monstrosities than you're gonna see anywhere else! ANYWHERE ELSE!!!And they all look freakishly amazing!And amazingly freakish!!A Chernobyl sideshow!!Each one is more unbelievable than the last!If you could believe the last one!!If I were to see this movie as a child, I would have been scared out of my skin tone.I would have been a blubbering, floor-clutching, puddle of a mess.If Zelda from "Pet Semetary" kept my eyes nailed open all night;this movie would've kept me up screaming and hugging my knees.There are so many horror-defining visulas at the end of this movie,you're gonna wonder if you're having a psychotic meltdown or a horrific epiphany.If "Freaked" had a big, ugly brother, it would be Basket Case 2.The acting is awful on almost everyones part.Everyone except Annie Ross, who turns the "creepy factor" all the way up through the roof.But everything else if the stuff hilarious nightmares are made of.This is the hidden horror gem you've been mining for.Behold it in all it's horror-comedy glory.MORAL OF THE STORY:It's 10:PM,Do you know where your hideously deformed, homicidal, siamese twin brother is?? </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> After nearly being killed in the closing events of BASKET CASE, Duane and Belial are whisked away to a safe haven for freaks run by Granny Ruth, where each of the twins find new love interests amongst her malformed tenants. Their new found sanctuary risks exposure when a group of nosy reporters intrude in their affairs, but the freaks won't give up their home without a fight! Frank Henenlotter dramatically increases the scope of this followup over that of the original, rounding out the production with polished cinematography, superior make-up and costuming, and a much more professional cast. The resulting film loses the quirkiness that had been found previously in place of a much more serious tone, although Hentenryck returns with his usual awkwardness. Granny Ruth's "children" have been given a range of unique, frightening, and unusual designs, but with so many strange new characters, Belial is unfortunately forced to take a back seat to much of the proceedings. In a particularly nightmarish sequence, the terrifying horde slowly ascends on a camera man in the strobe of his flash. In terms of production, BASKET CASE 2 far exceeds the original, but in doing so, it loses much of the charm and creative design seen previously. As a series sequel, it is still an enjoyable entry for fans of the first film.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies </p>

 <p> Finally the sequel to Frank Henenlotters masterpiece (masterpiece to me anyways!) is coming to DVD... and from the fine folks at Synapse Films to boot!  Basket Case 2 follows "brothers" Duane and Belial  through the trials and tribulations that followed directly after the first film (basically how they survived).  Fans of that film (or any of Henenlotters other movies) get all the bizarre tastelessness that they have come to love and expect including the Belial sex scene that you always THOUGHT you wanted to see (this is special!).  A bigger budget here means one thing mainly... more freaks (or the preffered term "Unique Individuals" as we find out)  for Duane and Belial to interact with which include some enjoyable additions as well as some plain awful ones (yet still enjoyable, just for different reasons).  Frank followed this up with another fun sequel worth seeing, although it's easily the worst of the bunch.  This has been a loooooong time in the making but now that it is here, make sure and pick it up as a good time is guaranteed (plus companies like Synapse deserve all the support horror fans can afford).  Now if only someone would take notice and release Phantasm 2... </p>

 <p> Basket Case 2 takes off where 1 left off. Duane and Belial survive the fall, and is in intensive care. Duane and Belial are saved by a friend of the aunt (Ann Ross) who save freaks for a living. It all seems good until a tabloid reporter tries to get info on the bradly twins, she soon get hers. Basket Case 2 is one of those films you can't help liking, it got its share of killings, gore, and excellent freaks fx by Garb, maybe BC2 is not better then BC1, but is sure alot better then BC3. Frank Henenlotter knows how to direct a movie! </p>

 <p> I have never seen Basket Case 2 until last night when I bought it yeserday Afternoon. And I have to say I was really amazed Not As Gory As the Original Basket Case and not as good. I love the seen where Belial jumps out of the Wicker Basket and jumps on the blonde reporter and turns her into a freak along with Belail and all his friends.Overall I would rate this a 4* out of 5*Now I Just Have to get my hands on Basket Case 3 which I have Never seenAlso Check out Brain Damage Classic Horror / Gory 5*P.S Frank Henenlotter Is A Horror God!!!! </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> BASKET CASE was a cult horror hit thanks to its gory premise and the story of two brothers, one normal and one a lumpen deformed monster, out for revenge against the doctors that separated them. The movie was a great premise for revenge against those out to destroy their very lives. Of course, you can't forget the ending in which the tension from Belial's jealously over Duane's romance with coy, busty Sharon builds to a rather unfortunate sibling dispute. After plunging from the third floor of the hotel from a brawl between each other, it may have been believed that they were both dead...ah, but this is a horror movie, and there's no way you'd really think that these two could not survive a fall like that.So, after inevitably surviving a dangerous plummet from the Hotel Broslin sign, Duane and Belial end up in a hospital, where the recuperation takes effect almost immediately for Belial, who's really pissed off and wants to get back at more of the people he doesn't like. So he and Duane, who looks badly bruised and just beat altogether, plan an escape, and they kill off a cop and manage to make their way out of the hospital. There's a snooping reporter, though, and she wants to expose them so they'll get justice for the murders. Granny Ruth and Susan, her daughter, decide to help the brothers recuperate and take refuge in her sanctuary of "unique individuals" who all have some deformities. We have a "pinhead" Frankenstein; we get a guy who has humongous teeth; we get a Belial-like girl who Belial falls in love with; and we get a guy with dozens of noses on his face...plus the other oddities you have to see to believe. When a cop and a reporter decide to team up, along with a sniveling little photographer, things get really out of hand. They try to infiltrate the house, and well, all the special people have other plans for them, and soon the photographer is murdered by Belial, and now things aren't what the reporter hoped they would be. Now, it's up to Phil to help stop the brothers, and he confronts them at a bar, which turns out to be quite the wrong move. The reporter's just desserts are equally as disgusting, and you'll actually enjoy the gruesome ending of the film that leaves it open perfectly for the not-as-strong BASKET CASE 3, which still manages to entertain. While awaiting the release of this flick on DVD in a US version, I am still entertained by the highly enjoyable original and the less memorable third sequel on DVD.Overall, though, BASKET CASE 2, while not as memorable as its predecessor, is still a very entertaining flick that feels more horror than comedy, though there are some mildly humorous moments, but most of that is left to the third film. If you liked the first film, you should find many things to enjoy with this very entertaining sequel. </p>

 <p> After seeing the 1st movie many will question how can there be sequal. This film kind of answers that question in the begining. This time around the Bradly brothers have some friends with them along for the ride. After being taken in by an old family friend they will find themselves having to stand and fight to protect their new friends and home. Much like the 1st movie this film has gore,comedy and horror mixed in really well together. This time both Duane and Belial find love(whach the "love" scene with Belial,absolutly priceless). This movie has a different tone then the 1st and a litlle bigger budget as the gore effects and Belial himself look better this time around. A must see for fans of the 1st film. Also watch the 3rd movie. </p>

 <p> Horror's favorite set of Siamese twins return.  They survived the fall and are now on the run from the law.  They find refuge with "Granny Ruth" who runs a kind of boarding home for freaks.  When a snoopy reporter catches wind of the "Freak Twins" residing with Granny Ruth, it threatens to blow the whistle on Ruth's family.  The freaks are then forced into action.The Basket Case concept may have seemed like a one trick pony, but Henenlotter's formula still works.  He even manges to expand and introduce new ideas where you wouldn't expect.  It winds up being a very interesting film that's just about as good as the first film(or even better according to some)  The humor is played up more, and this is a wise decision coz you really can't make a scary or serious film with this kind of plot.  Though still a low budget affair, Henenlotter is working with a bigger budget than before.  The freak makeup FX aren't terribly realistic looking, but they certainly are elaborate.  Sometimes it's even overwhelming.  Belial is touched up a bit.  In fact, I think he looks considerably bigger than he did in the first movie.  The movie goes for a more heartwarming and family type vibe with the freaks.  This is where my only complaint with the movie comes.  You're supposed to be on their side and hope they never get found out and exploited.  This is all fine and dandy, but there are scenes when Belial and the other freaks kill innocent folks who don't deserve it.  Even Duane and Granny Ruth seem to have no hangups about slaughtering a bartender just so the freaks could gain access to the bar for a few minutes.  I don't mind them slaughtering the schmucks who threaten them, but it's hard for me to work up sympathy for them when at times, they are no more than just cold blooded killers.  But that's not too big of a deal.  After all this is just a schlocky cult film, right?Anybody who liked Basket Case has probably already discovered this film, and certainly don't need a recommendation.  But just let it be said that it's well worth seeing for cult movie fan. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Switching gears a fair bit, "Basket Case 2" retains the continuity and the ferociousness of the first "Basket Case", and is certainly equally bizarre (if not more so!) but has added in more humor and even a great deal of fun.  Humor and fun?  After the searing and almost traumatically shocking nature of the original, adding in these elements in abundance , plus moments of great beauty, would be one thing - and would take a great deal of magic to pull off the transition - but to do it even while holding onto the savagery and the tragedy that made the original such a unique entry in the annals of horror is quite another.  Incredibly, just such a feat is pulled off flawlessly.  "Evil Dead 2" successfully combined intense goriness with comedic freakout-ishness, but this goes even beyond that. It's like combining "Gremlins" or even "Return Of The Killer Tomatoes" with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", something which should be impossible to do right without the contrasting elements crippling each other.  Another way to view it is the Creature Cantina scene from "Star Wars" done as a horror movie set at the Fawlty Towers hotel.Picking up years after the first movie, Duane and Belial find a place in the world at a home run by a kindly woman for 'unique individuals' (meaning Belial-type mutants, though Duane is readily accepted into the fold as well) and unique is certainly one way to describe them.  The greatly improved special effects are necesary to bring to life this weird and wonderful assortment of characters, and the acceptance into this haven quells Belial's murderous bloodrage.  Both he and Duane even find love in their new home.  But when their sanctuary is threatened by outside forces, it's an uprising the likes of which film has never seen before.Clearly, the ambiguity of the first movie gives way to a more direct representation of Belial as the protagonist, but by no means is he a tame creature, and it's not unthinkable that he could go completely out of control even after finding sanctuary.  The prescence of brighter elements in no way means the horror is gone, and there are shocks in the movie both happy and terrifying.  I'm probably not doing full justice to the movie, but a film like this simply defies easy description.  I noted in my writeup on the first one that there was never another movie like it.  Well, this is a worthy and faithful followup but indeed quite unlike its predecessor in many ways, yet somehow, despite all odds, maintaining excellent coherency.  And, there would never be another movie quite like "Basket Case 2" either - the third installment is even more bizarre and warps in different directions!  Truly, the Basket Case trilogy is one of the most unbelievable series in film history, and Part 2 is as mind-blowing as any of them.  This HAS to come out on DVD eventually. </p>

 <p> One Of The Best And Strangest Movies Ever </p>


<h2> review.date </h2>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Out of the small handful of films that Frank Henenlotter has made, BASKET CASE 2 has always been my favorite -- and it was frustrating that all of the others made it to Region 1 DVD years earlier (including the inferior BASKET CASE 3).  The original BASKET CASE had a sleazy charm all its own, and though it was never intended to be seen outside of the NYC theater district, it became an unlikely hit. By the time BASKET CASE 2 came along, Henenlotter had made two other films, and it shows.  This film features some amazing visuals, a fun, original story, mostly solid acting and many lovable characters -- though it's hard to tear your eyes away from jazz singer Annie Ross, who gives a wickedly charming, over the top performance as Granny Ruth.Synapse Films outdid themselves with the transfer of the movie.  The original NTSC video release was fuzzy (I bought two different copies and they were both fuzzy -- it looked better on HBO), and the colors were a little dull, which is a shame since it's such a colorful film.  The colors on this transfer are rich, the details sharp and the audio's crystal.  The lengthy "Behind the Wicker" featurette includes new interviews with Henenlotter and other crew members, as well as a lot of rare stills and never before seen behind-the-scenes footage (from both BC2 and FRANKENHOOKER).  "The Man in the Moon Mask" featurette, however, feels like it should've been spliced into the "Wicker Basket" one -- Emge seems likable, but his interview doesn't really warrant a featurette of his own.It's disappointing that star Kevin Van Hentenryck wasn't involved with this DVD (or any of 'em!), and that there's no commentary or trailer.  Still, I can't complain, since the film itself looks and sounds so good! </p>

 <p> Picking up right where "Basket Case" left off, "Basket Case 2" proves to be more of a crazy, fantasy-movie of a wild-ride than a horror sort of indulgence. Don't get me wrong, "Basket Case 2" is an absolutely brilliant and amazing movie, and probably the reason why half the synomyms for "crazy" were invented, i.e. "wacky", "loopy", "zany", etc. It's just THAT out there...but great at the same time!In this movie are more of the crazy, imaginative monsters such as Belial. Your eyebrows are gonna raise probably a dozen times in this movie, but if you can handle that, then this is going to be a newfound treasure trove of comedy-horror crossover goodness.I will admit, in comparison to the first movie, this one has a bit of a slower pace and can get a little dull in some areas, but when the excitement picks up again, it'll keep you entertained!Now despite the leaning towards the fantasy and comedy aspect, there's still a solid amount of blood and gore, giving the movie an "R" rating, and that shows that the movie still keeps a decent horror aspect for those interested. It just goes to show that this movie is strong from all angles. Definitely give it a watch, it's highly recommended! Thanks for the time, and peace. </p>
