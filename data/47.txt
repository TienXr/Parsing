 <p> Just got this from gold box for $169.Therefore it's cheap compare to other unit of same levelI have the ps3 and this pioneer is not much slower on start up.As for menu..just press menu and easily set to 720p or 1080pand auto and HDMI or other output.Almost all setup are yes/no question type. how hard can it be?Picture and sound quality is on par with the ps3.The unit is thin compare to first gen blue ray machine and remote looks clear.The Disc tray is definately not loose.It's normal like PC DVD-roms from samsungs or LG or sony etc..you can't compare this to slot load ps3 stle when you have a tray.you put a disc in and press a button to get it in...what do you do to"manipulated" the tray? The default setup was to 480i because for those people that don't have a HDTV..however, I hook it up to my sony receiver and sony HDTV and it comes right up through HDMI.A menu is a menu... already has 4 languange and explain to you how to setup all kind of different audio , video setup plus menu settings.what else do you want?This is a budget model. it's low price.if you want more function, pay extra 160 to get the one up model! </p>

 <p> This player crashes constantly - if i hit fast forward one too many times it will crash and I have to unplug, wait 5 seconds, plug it back in and then wait at least 10 minutes for the player to boot up. This happens constantly on Lost complete collection, Dexter Seasons 1-3, Supernatural Season 1 and Battlestar Galactica Complete collection.The latest firmware was released in April. I bought Alien Anthology Bluray, and I put in my Aliens disc, I get a error saying that I need a later firmware to play this disc. I'm already on the latest firmware!!!!!I contacted Pioneer by email, no response yet.. I think I am in warranty still, i'm not sure. They are only a year warranty.Here's some advice - All bluray players are crap. They are slow, crashy and have horrible warranty. I had a LG before and that stopped playing blurays all together, and they wont honor the warranty since its just 4 days beyond the 90 day labor warranty (bear in mind that the box said 1 year warranty, but the papers say 1yr parts, 90 day labor warranty) and now I got burnt with the Pioneer. Just buy a PS3 and forget everything else - at least those are constantly updated and can play uncharted.EDIT: unplugging for about 5 mins, then plugging it back in and waiting another 10 minutes made the movie play without complaining about firmware. Such a stupid player.EDIT 2: It's now September 2013. They released an update not too long ago that resolves a lot of compatibility issues. I am able to play all of Breaking Bad and American Horror Story on it, along with Aliens. It's still slow like molasses but at least it lasted this long. For that I'm revising to three stars instead of one.Nonetheless, the PS3 is still the best Bluray player.. At least until the PS4 comes out. </p>

 <p> I bought this as the BDP-121, a player identical to the 120, sold in Canada and in the US by warehouse stores, for $150 from CompUSA.com. The 121 does not come with a 1 GB flash drive. Until the 11/24/09 Pioneer firmware update the 120/121 refused to play Disney's Snow White BD, but now it does. However I am still having problems accessing Disney's BD Live on the player although I have accessed Warner, Paramount and Sony BD-Live. (Each requires separate registration, by the way.) This could be a Disney problem. To me there is little to complain about with the 120/121. The remote is 50% longer than most, but everything functions as it should. The BDP-120 sold here includes a 1GB flash memory stick which is required for BD-Live. If you need to update firmware, look here: [...] </p>

 <p> I purchased this player some days ago, while I was upgrading my TV to HD. I chose the BDP-120 for a specific reason: region codes. The consumer-hostile atrocity that some studios force on their customers hits people outside of the US (US = region 1) especially hard. My DVD collectio (almost exclusively region 1) is large, and I live in Switzerland (= region 2). The BDP-120 comes with a code-free DVD player, but *does* enforce regions on the BD. That way, I am able to retain my investment in DVD. NOTE: Make sure your version of the player has the same code-free capability, as I hear that in some countries they do not![Amendment, April 2012 - after only 30 months (2.5 years) of normal use, the player died on me. This is well below my expected 4 years for such a device. Disappointing.]]UnpackingI received my player inside a box that also contained a hefty manual, a remote, 2 AA batteries for the remote, a 1GB USB stick (for firmware updates), an audio-, power-,  and video cable. Neither Network (ethernet) not HDMI cable were included in the box (the omission of an HDMI cable is disappointing).Exterior & DesignThe player's outside is made from black plastic which does have a rather cheap feel to it. Unfortunately (it took me two minutes to find out), the shiny plastic parts scratche easily, so handle it with extra care when you slot the player into it's place. Buttons (power, play, etc.) are realized as small horizontal slats inside a horizontal recess, and feel flimsy (for comparison, my Yamaha amp that is roughly in the same price category has all buttons made from metal). The DVD tray is not dampened and gives off a rather cheap grinding sound when extending or retracting. When spinning, the disc is nearly inaudible, which is a great accomplishment, somewhat marred by the sound of what appears to be a fan that starts running inside the player when it gets warm.Slightly annoying is the fact that the player's width is 42 cm (16.53 inch) instead of the standard 43.5 cm (17 inch). If all your components are from Pioneer that may not be an issue. Since mine are not, the mis-fit is slightly noticeable on top of the Yamaha amp. The silliest, most painfully obvious and plain stupid design flaw, however, is the USB port. Instead of providing an easy access for USB on the front (perhaps behind a panel), the designers chose to put the connector on the back. Yes, on the back, where you'll have next to no access. Well, perhaps an extension cord could help? Maybe -- but the manual states clearly: "WARNING: DO NOT USE AN USB EXTENSION CORD". Now this is really, really bad design. Especially in light of the fact that any firmware update is facilitated by USB only (even if you have the player connected to the net). This design misstep is somewhat lessened by another seriously wrong design decision: even though the player provides a USB connector, you cannot play content from that port. Stone-age consumer appliance design. This forces you to burn any image (only JPEG supported) or video to disc, and then put the disc in the player (if you think network streaming via network port: well, not with this player).The player is adorned with a tiny alphanumeric status LCD and a multitude of colorful LEDs. The LCD is backlit by a garish white light that is plain ugly. Pioneer could have done much better, as I have seen better-looking LCDs on *Thermometers*. Also, while some LED do carry a label (e.g. 'Power', others light up sometimes, even flash, and then, after a short while, turn off mysteriously. What exactly they are for will forever remain a mystery (although not one I'd be inclined to spend time on resolving). All in all I feel that very little thought has gone into this player's exterior design. In a nutshell, it's a black box with a number of randomly placed flashing LEDs. Not impressive at all.The remote is rather large, deep black, and rests comfortable in the palm of even the largest of hands. The buttons feel a bit rubbery, and there is no audible or tactile feedback one a button engages. However, I would not have expected this from a remote for a device in this price range, and anyway, I'm using a universal remote (the Logitech Harmony 1000). Button labels are clear, but could have used a bit more contrast (on my remote they are colored in a yellowish off-white). Button lay-out is OK, centered around a mock-wheel (four directions and a central enter button). The remote also sports some buttons for controlling a TV, which I find somewhat silly, as they won't help you unless you have a pioneer TV, and if you do, that one comes with buttons for controlling your pioneer BD player). It uses standard AA batteries.HandlingNot having used a BlueRay player before I was shocked by how long it takes a player to load a single BD. At first I though that the device was defective, but when I looked at other players I saw first hand that the BDP-120 is one of the quicker devices. Still, from turning on the unit over loading a BD and then gaining access to a menu this device averages at about 1.5 minutes (for comparison: my DVD player, a $19 no-label but admirably performing device takes all of 20 seconds from power-up to menu selection -- and that includes loading a disc). I'm not sure what the 'Quickstart' feature means in this regard - I'd hate to have a player that takes even longer to start up. Also somewhat disconcerting is the fact that the unit takes about 30 seconds to one minute to power down (and beware -- simply pulling the plug will encur an additional startup minute the next time you switch it on).The buttons on the player itself border on being unusable (they are too flimsy, and provide only the basic pause/play/skip/open functionality). With the remote the player, once started up, responds nicely, but still a far cry from instantaneously (as you are used from a DVD). The on-screen displays and messages from the player are rough, ugly, and look like something straight from the debugger the engineeres used, interspersed with some artwork that appears to be lifted from Apple and WinAmp. Still, they work, and that's what they are there for. Switching from and to different modes is easy enough, and the organization of most menus is logical and intuitive.Although the player supports code free DVD (even though the (german) manual clearly states otherwise, which is disconcerting at best), it crashes regularly when you try to switch from a region 1 (US) DVD to a region 2 (Europe) BD, requiring me to pull the plug, and then wait through a prolonged power-up cycle. This adds insult to the injury of region codes. But at least the player supports my region 1 DVDs (but not region 1 BD).Features / Image QualityTo me, this is the most important aspect, and the one that saves this player. For the price, the player provides excellent image quality from both BR and DVD over the HDMI port to your HD TV. It will up-scale DVD content, which was to me an unexpected boon. Upscaling a DVD produces great results on my TV (1028p). Up-scaled content is only delivered via the HDMI connector, not via the additional composite video and video sources available at the back of the player. The provided composite video signal is OK, perhaps slightly on the weak side. As mentioned before, the analog connectors (composite video) do not provide upscaled content, but do allow the BR to be played to non-HD devices. However, BR's are nearly indistinguishable from their lesser DVD brethren on analog source (I have the BD and DVD versions of 'Planet Earth), while on HD the difference is plain to see (even though the DVD version gets significantly boosted by the up-scaling).The player also sports a network port (Ethernet, 100 Base-T). Unfortunately, this network port cannot be used to remote-control the player (as I had hoped). It is primarily there to stream content to the player from the internet (but not your PC). 100 MBit is somewhat on the weak side for this purpose, and accordingly, streaming a HD source to the player can cause stutters (not to mention that you better had invested in a switch or smart hub, or the whole subnet will drop from Gigabit to 100 MBit). Also (at least at my player's firmware level) the network port cannot be used to automatically download firmware updates. For this you use the (included, nice touch!) USB memory stick, onto which you must download the firmware from your PC. Furthermore, many obvious advantages that a network-enabled player could have are not implemented. As I mentioned above, you can't control the player via network, nor can you stream content from your PC to it. You can't query it's status (disk/track playing or status), nor does it automatically load a CD's album and track names from CDDB. Pioneer has a lot to learn in this regard. I currently regard the network feature as severely lacking.BD-Live... well, I guess it's just me, but for some reason this feature holds little interest for me. It just feels wrong -- like a "bolted-on afterthought". Perhaps I just havn't yet found the BD with real good BD-Live links. For now, all I found was wafer-thin content and a ton of advertising. Oh - and you must have the memory stick inserted when you use that feature. Nope, there simply is no real added value for me in this.The player does support the most common disk formats (CD, CDRW, Photo-CD, etc.) but supports a surprisingly limited amount of file formats: Images are limited to JPEG (with a stupid naming scheme to boot), and video files limited to the standard BD set (i.e. no Ogg, QuickTime etc). It does support AVCH, though (but that is no surprise as it is part of the newer BD standard).If you have a KURO (a Pioneer brand) TV, the player offers a 'KURO-Link'. Supposedly, this feature will allow the player and TV to talk to each other and allow both to select the best (or preferred) setting for each source. I do have a KURO TV (a plasma), but so far have not found any significant advantages. This may be related to the fact that my Plasma has a myriad of different settings, which the BD player knows nothing about. I therefore find myself often re-configuring the TV manually for a specific source (in other words: this feature is badly executed in the player).SummaryAlthough I am satisfied with the player's most important feature (image quality), there are many details that unnecessarily diminish this product: cheap exterior finish (Pioneer should have gone the extra mile and add more polish) with a front design bordering on ugly. It is slightly noisy when it gets warm. The omission of an HDMI and ethernet cable in the package is downright cheap. The non-standard width is annoying. Network integration is terrible, and too slow. Position of USB connector is downright stupid. No support for USB-provided media (Memory sticks or hard drives)On the upside: Good image quality and up-scaling of DVD does add a terrific advantage if you have a HDTV. Performance is good compared to other, even more sluggish players. Supports all popular disk formats. Integration with other Pioneer devices (KURO line).If you are looking for solid BD/DVD performance and do not care for most of the other niceties (USB playback, solid network integration), you should definitely look at this player. </p>

 <p> I purchased this to go along with my Pioneer receiver and am disappointed as I have to use both remotes for the Stereo and the Blu ray player.The display is very cheesey and hard to read and the buttons on the Blu ray player are hidden and Hard to locate.I wish now that I would have pruchased another brand. It does have a great picture and sound quality. </p>

 <p> I bought this because of Pioneers good reputation. Not all discs will play and Pioneer is slow to come out with updates.  It's frustrating getting blu-rays from netflix and the machine wont play the disc. I'm in the market for another one now. Hopefully someone will buy mine. </p>

 <p> Upon opening the box I saw the normal plastic bag of cables (no HDMI Cable) and remote batteries, along with a 1 gig Sandisk USB thumb drive. On the other side of the box was the remote (very long) that could have been down sized for the limited amount of buttons used to operate. The unit is very lightweight (which I don't hold against it) as many units are these days. The shiny black face (plastic) looks good and matches with the rest of my gear. The front panel lights are not overly bright and go without notice during viewing in dark rooms.Setup was straight forward (connection) HDMI, USB in rear and RJ45 via my squeezebox. Powering up is quick (less than 30 sec), and the menu comes up on first time startup. The menu setup is a breeze and and easy to navigate.I watched Eagle Eye first and was not all that impressed with the PQ, It was a bit clearer,(Rosario Dawson skin is not as smooth as we may think) but not eye catching, but it did give the look of film. The 2nd flick I put in was Hancock (Hi Def Master) and it was much better PQ very crisp and detailed It reminded me when I went to the Irvine Spectrum (Digital Theater) and saw SW-AOTC.To compare to my DV 45A I would say they are about even in PQ with the edge going to the Blu Ray. The DV 45A is connected via component cables and sound via toslink. Both units are routed through my Pioneer VSX 81TXs and outputted via HDMI to the new Vizio. The HDMI connection does handle the sound a little better in the area of separation of the channels. I will have to reserve my full opinion until I purchase a blu ray movie and really see how this new format shines. From the samples clips on the Hancock DVD it should be worlds apart. </p>

 <p> I bought this player to replace my new Magnavox BD player my grand daughter broke. This one has a better picture and much nicer and user friendly menu...setup was a breeze. It is slighty slower loading then the Mag but we buy these for picture quality...right? I did have a problem with the remote....I programed the product code for my TV into the remote but it's not fully functional...it will turn the TV on/off and control the volume and the channel up/down but it will not select input so I still have to use the TV remote (remember this is only for my TV). I also had a problem with the vendor,Electronics expo, but if you would like to read their,one star review,I suggest you check them out here on this site as they are one of Amazon's 3rd party sellers.=============================UPDATE!!!==================================After just 4 months of use this player has started failing.The player will only play DVDs now. This player was sold to me as new by Electronic Expo,one of Amazon's "partners"The Box,when opened,did not contain the audio/componet video cables that the manul says are included and the battries were installed.When I opened the disc tray for the first time,there was a Blu-ray disc in it all ready with the name,John C written on it in sharpy.So as you can see it wasn't new and Electronics Expo wanted me to box it up in the box it came in and another box over that one.Then pay the return shipping to them and a restocking fee! Oh yeah...they were out of stock of my player so they offered me store credit.I Would not reqemend this player or this vendor to anyone!!!! </p>

 <p> My initial thoughts are this is a Sharp re-badge. Although it is an attractive player, build quality appears poor. The tray rattles when opened and the front panel buttons feel thin and plasticy and like they might break if used frequently. The tray is loose and can be manipulated. The front facade on the tray is very loose and actually feels like it might fall off. Once again, it is an attractive player, but the led chapter readout is pure sharp. it is a dark purple with white lettering. It says BYE when you turn off the player.The Kuro Link does not work - when activated it was outputting 480i to my 5010. It took me three times of playing with the settings to finally get it to output 1080p despite it was set to auto out of the box. You cannot switch output resolution on the fly. The video output resolution button on the remote does not work best I can tell. The remote is slightly different than the 51/320:DSCN0897.jpgThe menu is set up with four basic selections. The GUI looks very budget and is not the refined GUI i love on the 51/320, though it is probably more straightforward. There are no tweaking menus for nr, brightness, etc. There is not deep color setting, but BD playback did appear as 36 bit on my kuro.There is no setting to adjust output resolution to 24fps. The display during playback is even worse (no mb/s read-out, no resolution).Performance:The cons: BD playback is a bit dull. I prefer the image on the panasonic 55, 320, 51 and oppo. SD DVD upscaling is standard, probably a hair worse than my panasonic 55. Jaggies appear in any closely spaced line and are visible in credits even when stationary. Responsiveness is sluggish and the player sounds like a blender - lots of grinding and gearing noises.The pros: Quickstart works - the disc tray opens immediately when you press eject. It has to be right at a second or two. It loads relatively quickly - QOS loaded in a respectable 42 seconds. It struggled with POCI - taking about 1 min 27 secs to get to the disney splash screen. </p>
