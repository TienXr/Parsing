<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> I really like the iluv </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> After various drops of our I-pad, we got the Iluv case, and it's been stellar to date.  Let's start with the most important part - protecting the Ipad.  At one point my two year old daughter got her hands on our Ipad and gave it a good whack into the granite countertop.  No damage.  No sign of damage.  To me, that's clear evidence that the Iluv is doing what it's supposed to.The iLuv is well-designed and good looking.  Frankly, for my purposes it's way better than those magnetic tops I see most people using that fold back to create a stand - it is far more durable.  Moreover, the black color is a bit less, well, off, then many of the other Ipad covers.On the downside, the iLuv is a bit bulky, and it does add weight to the Ipad.  With 3 young children at home, I'll deal with that, but others might view things differently.I really appreciate the iLuv, and I believe it's a great value. </p>

 <p> Nice, sturdy case and stand for iPad2 </p>

 <p> I have several cases for my iPad2. The Apple protector is okay, but doesn't really offer much protection, and I find it doesn't stand upright well enough to give me confidence in it. The iLuv is at the other end of the spectrum: it's really solid and protects your iPad, but at the price of adding considerable bulk. Still, when traveling, I like a beefier case, and this one has the added advantage of being a portfolio - in other words, it might be big enough to hold all the papers and other things you'd normally carry in your briefcase.In terms of construction quality, I'd rate it as a solid performer. Seems padded well enough to protect your iPad from being dropped, and it works properly with all the new iPad2 features such as going into low-power mode when the cover is closed. Whether you use it horizontally or vertically, you don't get the sense your iPad is going to tip over without notice.Overall, recommended if you like a big and somewhat bulky case that provides top protection and a convenient way to carry other stuff with you. </p>

 <p> This case is fine: it is a solid product.  I appreciate the quality of craftsmanship -- this case is not cheaply made and I've found all of the ports and switches are mostly accessible. It stays closed, and it looks pretty nice.  I'm not a big fan of the "iLuv" logo on the closure, but I can understand branding.My wife is the primary user of this case, and she upgraded from the Apple iPad2 cover: Apple iPad 2 Polyurethane Smart Cover - Gray (MC939LL/A).  In her opinion, she likes the protection that this case offers, but feels that it "confines" the device and makes the buttons hard to get to.  Plus, she says it has a funny smell.  In my opinion, that is probably temporary, but I don't know for sure.My main complaint with it is that it seems to lack the magnet used to automatically sleep/lock the iPad 2 when the case is closed.  I tried a few things here to see if I was missing something: 1) using the magnet from another case while the iPad was inside this case, 2) trying to stick a paperclip to the case in the right spot to see if there was even a magnet in the cover.  The paperclip sticks in what seems to be the right spot, but it appears that either the magnet is not strong enough to penetrate the thick case material surrounding the iPad when it is installed, or it is not in exactly the correct place to trip the iPad's sensor.  I have used the iPad2 Smart Cover we had to check this out and I am able to trip the sensor with its magnet while the iPad is in this case, so I'm leaning towards the weak or misplaced magnet rather than case thickness.My wife misses the ability to automatically lock the iPad and the upsides of having her iPad in this case don't seem to outweigh the downsides of more difficult to reach buttons/switches and lack of auto-lock. </p>

 <p> I like this a lot when  want to use my iPad in a standup position.  It is very solid, apparently well made, and easy to set up and maneuver.  The downside is that it creates A LOT of bulk for the iPad.  I kind of like the i-Pad's sleek, light weight, and this massive cover defeats that purpose. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Well protected, but thick. And what is up with the smell? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I've been using this for a month now and find that my iPad is very well protected. Of all the iPad cases I've tried (and I've tried about five of them) this one, by far, offered the most protection. So if you are rough on your iPads then I would highly suggest this one. But you pay for that protection... it is very thick. I've had people ask if I am sporting a keyboard in this case because usually cases this large have a built-in keyboard. Nope, no keyboard. Just very thick.My biggest gripe is the smell. When I first took it out it REALLY smelled. I thought it would go away in a day or two but a month later I can still smell it. It isn't as strong as it was when I first took it out, but something is wrong when you can still smell it. If the smell has gone down it is because I've grown used to the smell. I'm not sure what to compare the smell to, but it isn't pleasant.The swivel function is pretty nice. It is nice to be able to prop it up whether in landscape or portrait, depending on my task for form of entertainment. Once you prop it up it stays pretty much in place. And I didn't have any problems with it swiveling when I didn't want it to.If you are looking for protection, then at sixteen bucks you can't go wrong with this!! </p>

 <p> i had been using the AYL premium genunine leather case and while that's a great case, i wanted to try something else.the first thing i noticed about the iLuv icc821 premium portfolio case was its size.  where the AYL is like a snug sweater, the iluv is a poofy winter coat.  it's neither here nor there, but the iLuv is about twice the size (we're talking the thickness, not the horizontal or vertical width, if that makes sense).  i realized the thickness was a result of the swivelling/spinning compartment the ipad actually sits in.  you don't necessarily have to swing the whole case around to turn your ipad upside down.  just give it a twist and voila!  it's a nice feature, but i don't think it's a game-changer.i admit i do like the magnetic locking mechanism. it's an actual clamp that seals the case shut, which automatically puts the ipad in sleep mode.  with my ayl i have to be careful to make sure the cover is shut just so.  too many times i though it was shut, only to find out it wasn't and consequently had to recharge it.all in all, it's a nice case, but it is a bit on the bulky side.  if that's not an issue for you, then its a perfectly suitable case.a few people noted that it has a rather strong smell.  i personally didn't find it overly strong or even all that noticeable.  i guess it may just depend on your sensitivity to odors. </p>

 <p> This case hangs perfectly on my treadmill console </p>

 <p> For the first 2 months with my iPad 2, I'd been using the AYL 100% Premium Genuine Slim Leather Case for my iPad 2.  It's alright, but when sitting on my lap the case didn't want to behave, it wouldn't stay folded in its landscape typing shape.  And if it was propped up on my desk in its "movie viewing" mode, it was wobbly if I was doing a lot of tapping on it.This iLuv case doesn't suffer from those problems.  But, what I received isn't exactly what is pictured above... instead I received the newest iLuv model which has the additional option of "vertical mode" (so there's 3 different ways of propping this iLuv case up).  Also, there are 3 ridges on the inside of the cover that help keep everything upright.  It's sturdy whichever way I want my iPad propped up, offers a lot of protection for my iPad, and it's nicely priced (here on Amazon anyway... don't buy direct from iLuv, it's like 2-3 times more expensive at "list price").  The bad thing is it smelled like chemicals and plastic when I first unwrapped it, and it took a few days of airing out but now it's all good.  And it's not real leather, but that doesn't bother me at all.**THE BEST THING** about this case is it hangs perfectly over the top of my treadmill console so I can read or play games while walking on my treadmill (I play games like Siege Hero or Phase 10, games that only require me to tap -no swiping- with one hand while my other hand holds on to the side support rail).  My treadmill console has a rounded top, too, and yet this case remains safely in place.If there are any longevity issues, I'll be sure to update this review. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> More than meets the eye. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I'll be honest: I was all set to give the iLuve iCC821 iPad case a single star and a poor review. Instead, a single unadvertised feature has boosted the review an addition star or two, and it redeems the product's usefulness as a mid-level iPad 2 case.First, the bad:1. The case smells awful out of the box. I'm hoping this will air out, because it smells like a petroleum field. It's simply awful. I'm going to hit it with some furniture polish every day and see if I can't knock that smell out of it. The only reason this is not knocking it down further is because I have had other cases with this exact same problem, and it makes me believe that there's just something about the material and manufacturing process that makes this hard to avoid. Still, I wonder why companies like this don't leave the cases to air out, or spray them with something to kill that scent before shipping them to retailers, because it's terrible. It would sure make a better first impression if these cases were neutral-smelling.2. It's heavy. I'm talking about the whole package here, of course. It's definitely a lot bulkier and heavier than a lot of cases out there. While this does translate to better protection (I would not worry about dropping my iPad 2 in this case, that's for sure) it also makes my iPad 2 less of a decent fit in the netbook bag I like to use when I need my keyboard to go with me. I'd call this a bad-but-good feature. I certainly don't have any concerns carrying my iPad 2 around in this thing, but it does make it less comfortable to do so by a small degree.3. The 360-degree spinning mechanism is way too loose. This thing spins like the Mad Tea Party Ride at Disney World. This can be annoying at times, when you want to use the whole case but want to maintain a specific orientation. The thing will spin based on weight/gravity and then you find the iPad's orientation changing on you. I wish that iLuv had made it a little more rigid when it comes to spinning. It should be something that takes some effort, rather than being a free-wheeling, spin-crazy connection.4. The clasp is loose and floppy. It's great for securing the case closed, but when you have the case open the clasp tends to be all over the place. It doesn't seem to be removable by design, and as such it's sort of in the way about 3/4 the time. On the other hand, it also allows for a decent typing mode not unlike the Smart Cover's slight angle, and I do like that, so this is another bad-but-good feature.And now the good:1. As stated previously, this case provides some serious protection. If you're looking for security, I think you'll be happy with this case. You get protection and padding from all angles.2. There's a clasp. Honestly, I like having a clasp, and not enough cases (and believe me, I have about a half dozen of them) possess this feature, or forego it in favor of an elastic strap which is more of a hassle than it's worth. Here, we have a simple clasp held in place by a magnet. It works great, except for the loose nature of the clasp when it's not secured to the front of the case. It also doubles as a prop for the case, so it performs double-duty. I just wish it were more rigid and secure on the back.3. The 360-degree rotation is very handy for those of us who write novels on our iPad (Yes, it can be done. My first published novel saw a lot of time on my iPad 2). I imagine it would also be good for other applications, but from my perspective it's great for word processing.4. Stylish. While the case smells like a factory, it looks good. The design on the front is decent, and the company logo is downplayed. Too many cases like to splash their logo all over the place, turning your storage solution into a mobile billboard. Not so, here, and I do appreciate it. The design of the case, from an aesthetic point of view, is better than most.5. And here we are! The feature that changed my mind about this case: The interior snaps out, so you can carry it like a tablet is meant to be carried. That means you have the best of both worlds, here. You can have maxiumum protection when you need it, but you can pull the iPad and surrounding sheath out of the outer folder and drop all that weight and bulk, making it great for reading and playing games.It's curious that this feature is not mentioned anywhere. It's not mentioned on the packaging. It's not mentioned on this page's description of the item. It boggles me that the single most useful feature of this case is essentially unadvertised. I only figured it out by looking at the connection (wondering why it was spinning so freely) and said to myself, "Hey, that looks kind of like a snap."And it is. A firm pull and the inner case pops free from the outer case. Wham, bam, two cases in one! It's a true transformer of a case.So why doesn't iLuv mention this on the case's packaging or in the item description? I cannot say, but I encourage them to make it known that you're getting more than just a 360-degree swivel case, here. I have another 360-degree case (from Targus) and while I do like it a lot, the one thing I dislike is that I can't separate from the swivel mechanism when I want some freedom. iLuv figured it out and gave me the one feature improvement I desired in a 360-degree case, and then they didn't bother to mention it -anywhere-.So here's the finally tally: I'd give this case five stars if they'd ship it without the nasty smell, tighten up the rotating mechanism, and secured the clasp on the back of the case a little more. As it stands, the smell alone is enough to drop a star from the rating, and I'm being generous and overlooking the other two issues for now.Honestly, iLuv: Let these things hang up and air out for a month before shipping them, or figure out some way to not pollute my home with this terrible smell. It is unfortunate that you made such a decent case, and then sent it to market smelling like Lindsey Lohan's medicine cabinet.*I will update if the smell goes away. I hope it does. Even if the smell does go away, I can't bump this to five stars because the other issues remain... But I will have a lot more goodwill toward iLuv if the smell fades.Buying advice: Worth a look. Probably enough iPad 2 case for anybody who wants a good mix of protection and lightweight freedom, as long as you don't mind snapping/unsnapping the inner case in and out as you need it.* I could have gone for "Keith Richards" too, but I decided to remain topical and modern. </p>

 <p> Not in love with the iLuv </p>

 <p> This product is a clean miss.  First of all, it does not close reliably on the iPad2 when closing the cover over the screen of the unit.  What is worse is that this portfolio case does not have a magnetic fastener and therefore does not automatically turn the iPad off when securing the cover.  This is a critical missing feature at least for me.  This is a bulky, hefty case, and yet it has no pocket for business cards or anything like that.  I really wanted to like this case, but as designed I do not find it to be serviceable.  It is true that you can use this one easily to view in landscape or portrait mode, and better than some other cases.  So if that is your main criterion and need, the iLuv might be the case for you.  RJB. </p>

 <p> This portfolio is nice and professional looking. My iPad2 fits perfectly and securely without any slipping. One nice feature is that the case the iPad2 slides into attaches by a snap to the exterior cover that operates as a stand.  Its very easy to unsnap and hold the iPad2 like a true tablet. Another nice feature is that once you snap it back you can use the cover as a stand for viewing video. I find the viewing angles to be very good. All in all, its a really nice and I do recommend it. The only cons for me are that it has a odor right out of the box (although I assume it will go away over time) and I find the angle for typing to be a little too high. </p>
