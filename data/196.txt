<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Now, I am typically not one to generally insult a film.  I realize that when creating artwork there are those that devote their sweat, tears, and blood to the project.  While some films are horrendous, there is always the need to take a moment and appreciate the time that the director put into his/her work.  Alas, with Drawing Flies that theory doesn't apply.  What has happened with this film is simply two directors wanted to have a good time, sold Kevin Smith on the concept (a darn good sales pitch if you ask me), asked him to invite his friends, and they would provide the room and food.  It reminded me of those first parties at college where you don't really know anyone, but you still invite upperclassmen so that it won't be a total bust.  That is exactly what happened with Drawing Flies.  While the directors (yep, sadly there were two) will complain about their lack of budget and film, I believe they got exactly what they wanted.  A cheap independent film that can be endorsed by Kevin Smith and stars the now popular Jason Lee.  Good or horribly bad, those are some decent names to boast for such a cheap film.Drawing Flies was a cheaply made film that carried with it a sloppy story.  In all attempts to pull in a independent crowd and possibly create a "cult" classic, these directors have done nothing more than provided us with an hour and ten minutes of pure slop.  The beginning should have been our tell-tale sign when Jason Lee's voiceover provided the first ten minutes of the film laying what could have been the groundwork for the film, but instead just random dribble.  There was no A-B-C logic in this film.  There was no defined story.  There were no intelligent characters.  There was literally no emotion.  I could continue this "missing" list for quite some time, but I would need several milk containers.  All this film had was Kevin Smith's View Askew production name stamped (very proudly ... nearly too proudly) on the front and actor friends that apparently didn't care what a decision like this would do to their career.  The entire "Jay & Silent Bob" moments were only included in this film to pull drooling fan-boys to the rental stands.  They had no impact on the actual story itself.  In fact, the mere seconds that they share aren't even funny, just clich&eacute; and completely cheap.I hate to continue to use the word "cheap" to describe this film, but as I watched the production value of Drawing Flies fall dramatically as the 76 minutes came closer and closer to ending, I kept thinking of those $1 movies found in those bins at your local stores.  They may be good movies, but the value is so cheap that you nearly feel like the $1 isn't worth it.  That is how I felt with Drawing Flies.  One minute we are at a beer guzzling party, the next we are moping about welfare, and the next we are in the woods concerned about Bigfoot.  Where was the logic behind these segments?  My answer ... there was none.  This film was a cheap attempt at creativity, mental instability, and those darn Sasquatch.  For a View Askew production, the voice dubbing was horrendous, the actual acting was atrocious, and the sets were amazingly poor.  Even the outdoor shots just screamed "Blue Light Special".  Nothing worked in this film.  Nothing of value was created.  Nothing could make a mother say, "I am proud of the work my son has done."  That is sad.I am tired of Kevin Smith. While I love Clerks (both the live-action and cartoon) and think Chasing Amy is one of the most brilliant films about modern culture created, Smith has continued to disappoint his die-hard fans time and time again by feeding us cheap clich&eacute; moments like that of Jay & Silent Bob in Drawing Flies.  It is as if he has found his one character and is not afraid to exploit it to the very end.  Jason Mewes should not continue to work.  Jason Lee needs to stay focused.  He is an exceptionally talented actor, but this film could seriously ruin his resume.  Everyone else just did this film because Smith was involved, and Smith was involved only because he likes to think that he still has his hand on the pulse of independent cinema, but alas he does not.  Kevin Smith is mainstream, even when Passion of the Clerks is released it just won't have that pizzazz it once did.  His originality is gone and we can only blame films like Drawing Flies for that change.Overall, in case you haven't guessed already, this was one of the worst films that I watched this year.  As the year begins to close, I thought that good cinema would be pouring in, but if I continue on the Drawing Flies path, I do not see good things in my future.  I am tired of clich&eacute;s, of overused pop culture references, and of Kevin Smith.  I am disappointed in this film because it wasted 76 minutes of my day.I just kept waiting for these lines to pass our character's lips:"I gave you BACK the map, Heather.""I gave you the map.""I gave you BACK... THE MAP."Grade: * out of ***** </p>

 <p> unless you're talking about picture and sound quality, which in this case is the absolute worst i've seen on any dvd.. but apparently, they did the best with what they had.What we have here is an extremely bizarre half-story about a man losing his grasp on his mind, and how far his friends are willing to follow him into his madness.  No, it doesn't always work.. no, the acting isn't always the best.. but it's a dvd i don't regret buying.  Jason Lee, Carmen Lee, and Renee Humphrey turn in pretty good performances.. and even the stoner-eyed Mewes makes good with some on target delivery at times.  View Askew fans will also get a chuckle out of seeing Scott Mosier in a diaper.. as well as Silent Bob's cameo, and the credits that state Silent Bob was played by himself.On the other hand, i'm not sure what this movie has to offer non View Askew fans..  if you're not a fan, you should probably pass on this one.. unless you feel like buying an EXTREMELY low budget indie film about stoners in the woods and sasquatch.In any case, this DVD is... enough to take a gamble on even if you're not sure about it. </p>

 <p> Breathtaking scenery and a Blair-witch type of filming (but not so dizzy).Donner (Jason Lee) leads his friends into the wilderness under false pretences. Donner would like to see Bigfoot...pardon me, Saskwach. The others intend to go to a non-existent cabin; some more reluctantly than others.Don't get hung up on the plot. Though seemingly ridiculous, it holds quite well through the performances of the actors. The most impressive thing is the interaction between them:  an all too real portrayal of "slackers" reacting to adventure and camping. Some don't want to go; some think it might be cool so long as there is comfort down the road, whereas one is driven by a vision.A question of insanity lingers, and the dynamics in dealing with this individual is a stunning reality. Misdirected anger to pitying sadness, self-centred dismissal to simple fear. A long stretch of colourful characters within an artistically directed black and white movie is mesmerizing in an uneasy way.It's eclectic. </p>

 <p> If you're looking for a textbook definition of how to make a movie, this is not the place to go. The direction is pretty poor, the cuts are terrible and the transfer on the disc is sub-par at best.But the story is a LOT of fun.Jason Lee heads up a cast of mostly View Askew regulars (including the woefully underused Renee Humphrey and a cameo by the always-beautiful Joey Lauren Adams) on a trek deep into the woods of Vancouver. To say any more would be to give away too much, but suffice it to say this movie gets weirder with every scene.The strength of the film lies in a really good cast working with a totally off-the-wall script. If you can stand some of the poorer technical aspects, it's a movie worth watching. (And let's face it, &quot;Clerks&quot; wasn't exactly a directoral masterpiece either.)This movie is especially nice for View Askew fans for the chance to see Jason Mewes play a character other than Jay for a change. </p>

 <p> I love the soundtrack and I actually like the raw quality of black & white with the texture of a 1930's reefer madness film. I don't think that this version has been digitally enhanced and I feel that this film will become a huge cult bonanza in DVD sales. It's refreshing to see the actors that became better known early in their career. I will not spoil the film but it grows on you, or at least myself. I was pissed the first time that I put the disc in the player and didn't pay attention, I was being lazy and expected Hollywood to burst through my television and entertain me. This film is meant to be carefully watched since the dialog is crucial. This is not like putting on a copy of "2012" or "Pathfinder" and hear your room quake and have the film immediately suck you in. Since I view an average of two films a day I set up a big TV in my gym and most big budget films grab me with modern psychology and the science of immediate gratification through sound and shock almost immediately . But if a film viewer relaxes and imitates the mood that the cast creates through a smoke screen of well, smoke, then I believe you will have fun. I hope I helped. by Craig Barr. </p>

 <p> This film is a bit like &quot;blair witch&quot; meets &quot;clerks&quot;.Unfortunately, it's the worst of both worlds. The film fails at having any sort of suspense or real drama, and at the same time fails to have any witty dialogue so characteristic of view askew's most famous film: &quot;clerks&quot;.The story is razor thin and uninteresting. The characters, despite being played by those well known to Kevin Smith fans (e.g. Jason Mewes), are undeveloped and pretty dull.If you do insist on wasting your time, at least save your money. If you're a big Kevin Smith fan who just have to see this, go rent it - save your money for a movie worth watching twice. </p>

 <p> I know it's a little odd but I think this may be a little better than CLERKS. Drawing has some great yet bizarro humor (Bizarro from selab). The movie also has a directors cut and theatrical version so that way you can see both great features. Just in case you wanna know, the movie is about a guy who is on the verge of having a nervous break down (or losing his, I can't tell which) and then he decides to look for bigfoot, so he lies to his friends and says that there is a cabin where his Grandfather lives but it is in the middle of the wood. The movie is jam packed with laughs. If you life Kevin you love this movie. If you like bizarre humor, you'll love this movie.By the way, Jason Mewes is in this movie you know Jay from Clerks. </p>

 <p> by dane youssefThe Canadians approach to filmmaking is either bland, campy or downright blood-and-guts (usually in the "campy" gory vein, of course).Most Canadians are as good at the art of film as mimes are at capturing the art of sparkling conversation.Ever hear the expression, "it was halfway decent? Comes up halfway? Meet me halfway?" I had that thought stuck at the top of my head after viewing this one.That's about the perfect way to describe "Drawing Flies," a Canadian-based indie featuring a sprinkling of an American-based cast and crew.The first half of the movie starts out as a variation of the whole "Dazed and Confused" or "Slackers" genre, where we see some contemporary socially-relevant slacker types in Canada living on steady welfare. Then we see them go on the big self-discovery trip that's the big turning point of their lives.The Canuck Government cuts them off and they take the last bit of money they have in the world, pool it together and instead of paying the necessary monthly rent check, they blow the whole damn thing on a cover-charge at some party and dope.Now totally and completely bankrupt, they move out of their place (they're living four to a single apartment) and hit the road. They then exile themselves to the deep, deep woods where they plan to make permanent residence. Thus, this is where the real journey-theme of the movie kicks in. This is where the part of their lives that has worthy interest to be a movie kicks in.Or should anyway.Jason Lee (as always) proves that any movie with him in it alone is worth seeing (OK, except for the unforgivably bad sedated-comedies "A Guy Thing" and "Stealing Harvard"--well, hey, if Tom Green's in it). His performance starts out earnest with life-affirming optimistic hope and child-like charm, but then U-turns into angry, road rage and his long-repressed dementia kicks in. It's the type of character he's played in damn near everything, but it's still thrills and shakes.Mewes' performance here is kind of uneven. I mean, he's not really an actor--he's basically just a friend of filmmaker Kevin Smith who plays himself in movie after movie. Like Julia Roberts, he's not really an actor--he's more of a TV talk-show personality. Jason Mewes stretches (somewhat) as a welfare-starving slacker who curses and smokes the dope, but not nearly at the level that his legendary Jay character does. He (like most of the cast) seems to have trouble swallowing the overwritten and unrealistic dialogue.He doesn't talk so much about getting laid and eating out ***** as much, either. Mewes' Az character is more of somewhat-more-down-to-earth regular Stoner than a near-cartoonist comic relief.Carmen Lee (they were married at the time of this one) does the worst job in this one. Every word, every facial reaction, every moment from her sounds horribly unconvincing. She is here, beyond a doubt, not only the absolute worst performance in the film, but the worst acting I've ever seen. Hopefully, Carmen will stray from acting and find almost any other day job. She would be more adept to make a living donating sperm.The movie's plot echoes "The Blair Witch Project:" A group of friends go on a long, long trip in the deepest woods on earth and into the great unknown. Then, a hidden agenda is revealed. One that may bring wealth and legendary status. It sounds (of course) to everyone else like s collision of insanity and stupidity. But doesn't every ground-breaker at first?Everyone sneers and turns against each other. It's all sides divided. Bedlam, as always. The Loch Ness Monster. Sasquach. The Boogeyman. They're all just good old fashioned monster folklore stories, aren't they? There's always evidence (of course) that tilts to the contrary.Like I said from the start of this review (where you came in), "Drawing Flies" is a "halfway decent" film. If you only see half the movie, you'll walk away having a better cinematic experience than you would if you saw the whole thing. Just see half. It really doesn't matter which half. Just see half. The movie starts off in one frame of mind, then shifts jarringly in another direction.And damn it all, the two just don't mesh. They clash wildly like yogurt and broccoli. Just imagine for a second that resulting, lingering taste.Doesn't draw much attention... or even much interest.(WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS A MILD SPOILER--It does not reveal the entire film nor does it give away the ending, but it does reveal a brief surprise... that disappoints):Indie-idol Kevin Smith (the fat hairy one himself) pops up in a bit part that feels like an extra.He's at the end, he doesn't have so much as a word of dialogue, and he's dressed just like well... Silent Bob. And I mean SILENT BOB. He wears the same clothes he's worn in the first three movies.And it's not like there much here to distinguish this bit part from his legendary Silent doppelganger. Smith dons the same outfit, same mime facial expressions. He even sports the exact same beard. What, the budget was so low, he couldn't afford a shave or at least a trim? Or time to get another set of clothes from out of his closet?Hey, it's a no-budget film, they couldn't afford a wardrobe department as his character is referred to as "John." You kind of wish there was just a little more of a punch line or pay-off, but....But this time, there is no moment where he breaks the silence. The only difference between "John" and "Silent Bob" is... one is something, one is not...[...] </p>

 <p> VIEW ASKEW PRODUCTIONSPRESENTSDRAWING FLIESLike almost everybody else I went out and bought this film based on the fact that it was a View Askew Production and starred Jason Lee. But unlike almost everyone else who has viewed this film I think that this movie is brilliant. I' am sure people who are reading this and have seen the film are gasping, but if you really sit down and watch the film for what it is I guarantee you will believe the same as me.The story follows a group of friends who live in Canada and are all about to be kicked out of their apartment due to the fact that they have no jobs and are not granted welfare. Donner, who is the unofficial leader of the group decides he wants to go find Bigfoot or a sasquatch as he likes to point out. Knowing his friends will never go for it he decides to trick them into following him on this exhibition by saying his Uncle has a cabin in the woods that they can stay in. Since they will no longer have an apartment to live in they decide [some reluctantly] to accompany him on this trip. As they go deeper and deeper into the woods Donner starts to lose his grip on sanity and the group is even ran off by a group of men in large diapers. Az even falls from a tree and gets messed up pretty bad, and when his cut gets infected it becomes life threatening. So with no where to go once all is revealed the friends have a choice, stay with Donner as he slips into insanity or try and make their way back.As with any View Askew film the performers for the film are familiar faces for the most part. All will recognize leading man Jason Lee in the role of Donner. As always Lee gives the best performance of the film delivering with quick comedy wit, while at the same time showing more of a dramatic turn when he starts to go crazy. I think that it is an interesting fact that this was the role that Kevin Smith saw Lee in and decided he would cast Lee in "Chasing Amy". Another familiar face turns up in Lee's ex wife Carmen, who delivers well as Cassady. Jason Mewes of "Jay" fame turns up as Az, Jason as usual is the biggest comic relief of the film. Renee Humphrey is also in this film, as well as a fresh face in the View Askew world Martin Brooks. Brooks surprised me as he turned in an excellent performance; I wish he would make more films. Also a great moment in the film occurs when Kevin Smith cameos as "Silent Bob" in the film and accidentally runs into Jason Mewes's character Az. After a brief quite second between the two as they look at each other, they move on as if it never happened. But the most brilliant thing about this film has to be Scott Mosier joining some other guys in the middle of the woods in nothing but a diaper. That has to be the greatest part of the movie, except maybe Lee's scenes where he admits what the trip is all about and gets in a fight with Cassady.For a film that had an extremely low budget of 40,000 [if I' am not mistaken], this film even in black and white looks great. Brian Pearson did a pretty good job of making this film look as good as possible. And writer, producer, editor, directors Matt Gissing and Malcom Ingram did an excellent job with this film. The script had to have been great because this film turned out brilliant, if the Sci-Fi channel ever tried to make a film that would make Kevin Smith proud this would be it. Speaking of which, I' am so glad that Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier decided to back this film because it was definitely worth it in my eyes.I would recommend this film to any and everybody out there who has a taste for films that are a little bit out there. Also be sure to check out the two commentaries on the film, the first by the Directors [that one is for all the technical behind the scenes stuff]. And the second featuring the directors, Smith, Mosier, Mewes, Lee, and others, that one of course is the livelier of the two. </p>

 <p> I bought this movie "blind" because it was the "lost" View Askew film.  While Kevin Smith is kind of uneven as a director (Clerks, Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob were great, Mallrats was acceptable, and Dogma was juvenile but funny), this is a project he helped fund.  Starring Jason Lee and Jason Mewes (Jay) of View Askew fame, plus a lot of other Askewnies including Smith himself, this film details the lives of a clutch of welfare bums in Vancouver.  When their welfare is cut off, they have to come up with a new plan.One night, while watching a nature documentary, Jason Lee gets the bright idea to go look for Bigfoot.  Except, he doesn't want to tell his friends, because they might think he's a psychopath.  So he tricks them into going camping with him, in an effort to drive the group deeper and deeper into the woods.  Things start to unravel from there as the group fights about drugs, sex, and food (in that order, I might add).There's a lot of problems with this movie.  Shot in dirty black-and-white, it's very hard on the eyes, and it seems like no effort was made to clean it up for DVD.  The acting is only passable (it seems like everyone knows they aren't getting paid for this, and they are trying to wrap ASAP).  The plot, while promising, doesn't pan out.  The pithy dialogue that is View Askew's trademark is absent, and the potential for a Blair Witch-style horror film is wasted on recycled bong jokes and stoner `philosophy.'The DVD presentation is decent: sound isn't any better than two-channel stereo, but it doesn't really have to be.  There are some deleted scenes (and you can use seamless branching to put them back in the movie - congrats for that, at least!)  The commentary is funny, much moreso than the movie itself, as the cast and crew sit around trashing it and talking about how awful it is.I wouldn't even recommend this to a Kevin Smith fan, without renting it first.  To the average viewer, go get Chasing Amy instead.  You'll thank me. </p>

 <p> If you're a die-hard Kevin Smith fan (who does make a cameo), this is a must for your collection.  As with most View Askew releases, it's a pretty well-loaded DVD:- Directors cut of the movie w/ additional scenes,- boopers/outtakes,- an introduction by Kevin Smith and Producer Scott Mosier,- audio commentary with the View Askew gang,- easter eggs. </p>

 <p> ... I actually like it. I'm bordering on loving it, its only a matter of time and viewings. Maybe I'm just too big of a Jason Lee fan to not love this movie. In the first few minutes of was inclined to agree with my View Askew bretheren that it wasn't the greatest film ever made, but then Carmen started climbing over the welfare desk and I said "I've gotta watch this a little more". I'm glad I stuck around, very glad indeed. The second Jason started dancing with the Sasqautch, I said "this is one of the greatest movies ever!!" I don't know what it is, but that moment is hilarious. I nearly fell out of my chair. I'm serious. So, in short I finished watching it and I have come to like it more and more each time I have seen it. It has a certain inescapable charm. I don't care what anyone else says. If you like View Askew and you like Jason, you should, I repeat should, like this movie. I can't garauntee it. Rent it if you are in doubt. Its worth at least that. </p>

 <p> I love Kevin Smith and all his View Askew films. This is not at that level. The low-budget style does not work like it did in Clerks. Besides Lee and occasionally Mewes, the acting is week and dialouge is messy and not as strong as a typical View Askew film. I went into this movie with modest expectations and really wanted it to be another View Askew classic but alas it is not.Acting: 3 star (Lee's charecter is quite good and he pulls it off nicley, but no other actors resenated with their charecters)Plot: 1 1/2 star (perhaps the poorest execution of a potentially funny story, just didn't match up)Production: 2 star (knowing they had little resources it wasn't bad, but still not even the same level as Clerks, audio is terrible)Overall: 2 star (I have to be firm but fare, I wanted it to be good, but it really wasn't) </p>

 <p> As a long-time fan of Kevin Smith's work, I was so excited I was squirming when I heard there was another View Askew film. The day of its release I was at the rental store with it in my hand. With such great anticipation, however, I must say it was met with only mixed feelings.This is the tale of five people in Vancouver who have been living off welfare checks until one day they are cut off. Stumped as to what they are going to do now (and certainly not inclined to go get a job), they wander the streets aimlessly until Donner (Jason Lee) comes up with a plan to run off to the wilderness for a camping trip. He, however, has ulterior motives as he leads the group deeper into the Canadian wilderness.Though this film had the feeling of the other View Askew films, it just didn't measure up. Smith only produced this film; he did not write and direct it as was the case with the Jay and Silent Bob series. It is quite clear that it lacks the brilliant dialogue that makes Smith's films the gems that they are. Though the analysis of Scooby-Doo is hilarious and there are the occasional zinger lines, for the most part it is flat and lifeless. As a matter of fact, there are moments when it feels as if the screenplay is non-existent and the actors are merely on camera ad-libbing as best they can. Even Jason Mewes fails to elicit the usual uproarious response and Silent Bob's cameo is expendable.Still, the film does have its strengths. The overall feel evoked is that of an indie film and the grainy black and white footage is reminiscent of Clerks. By far, however, the biggest plus of the movie is Jason Lee. Whether playing the coarse Brody of Chasing Amy or the delightfully wicked Azrael of Dogma, Lee is always a treat to watch, and this is no exception. He is by far the most under-rated actor on the scene today. Lastly, the final twist of the film is incredible. Though I saw it coming, it was still enough to elicit a laugh from me. What the screenplay loses in the middle, it almost makes up for in the closing sequence.Overall, this is not a bad film. It's better than the vast majority of [stuff] that the Hollywood studios manufacture for the masses. Perhaps too, my high opinion of Smith's films and my great expectations for this one jaded my opinion a little. However, don't expect another Clerks when you watch this one. I rate it a 6 out of 10. </p>

 <p> The Lost View Askew Film </p>

 <p> First of all, I am pretty sure the filmmakers intended this movie to look like a 30's B&W monster movie. Kevin Smith has financed a couple of his buddies' (A Better Place, Vulgar) films, and they look fine. The grainy, washed-out look gives this flick an odd, but original look. Almost like it was discovered after being locked in a basement for 75 years. The sound sucks. I won't defend it. The movie itself is slow at times, but it's great to see the View-Askew whole gang together on film, and it's even more fun to listen to them goof around on the commentary track. Jason & Carmen were married when this movie was made, and it's cool to see them together acting. I could do without the lead actor, but only because he's not one of the "regulars" from Smth films. The extras are good and there's a GREAT blooper where the cast acts like drugged out weirdos. This goofy scene almost justified the...price (when I bought it from Amazon). Plus, the movie is RARE and I have yet to see it in a store. It will eventually go out of print, and will be lost forever (again). So buy it already! Peace.... </p>
