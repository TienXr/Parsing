<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I bought this book based on the reviews, both positive and negative, because the mentioned cheating wasn't a deal breaker for me as I sometimes like fiction that isn't always rosy hued.  I won't include a summary of the story as the other reviews and the blurb does a good job of painting a picture.  The starting dialogue was a bit shaky with an abundant use of `I daresay' but nevertheless I got into the reading and finished it in one night. This review is obviously what I got out of the book and usually if there is something in a book that repulses me, my whole reading experience is controlled by that repulsion.(Spoilers)First, I realize that the female audience is probably the bulk readers of these kinds of fiction and oftentimes stories are female-friendly (my opinion), but I honestly felt pandered to with this book! I am a woman and absolutely believe in equality between the sexes, but holy snaps, it was THE overarching theme of this book to the point that I couldn't connect with Tara. She went to Gothman city as a learning, discovery part of her coming of age tradition, and I didn't find her open-minded because every contrast that she made left the city and people wanting when compared to her Runner life. Throughout the book, it was all about her proving her equality to Darius over and over. I got it...she was a warrior and future leader of her clan and grew up where she was equal to the men there,  but she had to try to best/prove to Darius in everything...sexually, tactically, physically that she was his equal!!!  Over and over she dissected every action he made because, heaven knows, she was not going to submit to him in anything! Naturally, for her to be so far on the equality totem, he had to be on the opposite side, but that was the thing. I didn't find him to be controlling at all!! His society was what it was and he was who he was because of his position and his upbringing, but I felt like he made concessions and compromised for her and to her but she didn't. She wanted them to be equals, but I felt he was emasculated! When she found out she was pregnant, he deferred to her judgment on either terminating the pregnancy so she could remain a warrior (so not a marriage or in this case, a claim!!)Even the way that he crafted his speech to her about leaving the war and returning home to protect the children, a move that she knew she should've done on her own, seemed like he had to speak in such a way her equality seeking sensibilities wouldn't get offended! During her confinement her thoughts rang along the line that it took two to create the babies therefore he will wake up in the night, change diapers, feed them...cause they were equals (get it?!)However, he wasn't even consulted on the names of their twins. She told him what their names were!! I realize that there were other moments in the book where they were good together and she did admirable things, like when she saved him, but it got lost in my awareness of how the book extolled the virtues of this shining example of female equality!! Then the big infidelity, which didn't amount to anything (in my opinion)and didn't mesh with the story at all, paved the way for a perfect clich&eacute;d performance of the betrayed/wronged female where Tara exacted revenge on her husband/claim and called the other woman the usual `bitch' `whore' etc. Are you kidding me?!?! Then, the book went downhill from there because I certainly didn't agree with the righteous, wronged woman behavior that ruled her afterwards, where she took the children from their father (apparently he had equality only when she said he did) and went on an adventure for quite a long time with zero communication to the father about his children, an 'adventure' that of course exalted her skills as an equal-to-men laser toting warrior! And when she found a notice that her husband was searching for her, the only thought that could intrude was that he made it sound like he owned her!As I said, I felt like as a female reader I was supposed to get on board and root for the female character and be all like hell yeah girl, you give that cheating bastard what he deserves, don't back down, you show him that women are equal or even better than men...but I couldn't. As a rule, I try not to suggest alternative books to other readers in lieu of the one I am reviewing, but I will say that I have found only one book (or series) that was the perfect blend of a female warrior who was far superior to the male warrior but whose relationship embodied respect and equality. I thought that this one was going to be such a dance between warriors and how they dealt with a not so rosy life, it wasn't. According to the author's foreword, she wrote this book during a dark period and I felt it in the book. I certainly won't discourage anyone from reading this book and forming their own judgment as I did. However, I am not even remotely interested in reading the other parts to this book. </p>

 <p> I was unsure I was going to finish as some of the interaction between the hero and heroine were a little brutal.  I'm not really into abusive men, and if I had been Tara I would have shot him a lot sooner.  I understood the cultural differences, but no woman wants a cheating beating male who should somehow choke on his tongue in his sleep.  But it was a really well written story and held my interest and the world itself was the main character and kept me reading when I would get disenchanted with the characters.I am looking forward to how the story moves on with Tara's Revenge. </p>

 <p> CLAIMING TARA is set in a unique world. It's a futuristic setting but has a very historical feel with their culture and values.There are two different factions of people that this story focused on--the Runners and the Gothman. Tara's a Runner; her people move around and don't stay in one place too long. They're a group of warriors, both the men and the women. Tara was in her Age of Searching and was going through a time of self-awareness. During this searching, she went to Gothman.In Gothman, women were considered submissive and are treated as such.  A woman could be claimed (married) by a man without her consent or even knowledge, for that matter. Tara was a very strong heroine, so you can imagine how she felt about all that.As soon as Lord Darius, the Gothman's leader, met Tara, he wanted her. He saw a strong woman, someone who was different, who didn't willingly throw herself at his feet and he saw the value in that. Darius is your typical alpha male. He saw Tara, wanted Tara and that was that. He was going to have her. She did fight him on this a little bit, but she was such a feisty character that I would have liked to see this come through during their little mating dance. She gave in to him a little too easily for my tastes. Especially since Runners and Gothman are considered enemies, this could have made for a lot of fun banter and shenanigans.Darius had some major faults and made some major mistakes, but he was true to his culture, so I was able to accept this about him. Mostly. I always find it fascinating when such a hero can still be made likeable and is someone I ended up rooting for.This was an enjoyable story. There was romance, action and adventure. What I especially loved was the world building and the atmosphere that was created by the author. It was something different and made for an interesting read.Reviewed by Breannfor TheRomanceReviews.com </p>

 <p> It's tradition that Runners on the cusp of adulthood leave their clan to explore Nuworld and experience different cultures, this is known as the Age of Searching.  It's a time of grand adventure and discovery but Tara uses it to assuage her curiosity about the Gothman.  Raised in a society where women are taught to fight and work alongside their men Tara finds it difficult to understand one where only the men are trained in battle while women are considered little more than property.  Gothman and Runners are powerful races in their own rights, but they are enemies and the Gothman has a policy that Runners who cross their border are to be shot on sight.  Tara's solution to that little kink in her adventure is simply to not be seen.Lord Darius recently took over as the ruler of the Gothman following his father's demise and his oldest brother, Juro's, subsequent drowning soon after.  He's a powerful and fearless leader who doesn't tolerate any insubordination or defiance and sees no reason to change the ways of his people - even if he does question some of the policies his father instituted. The shooting of Runners on Gothman land doesn't strike him as reasonable and he chooses to rescind that order and soon discovers that there's much to be admired about the Runner people.Thanks to Patha's stories Tara knows to visit Reena, a Gothman living on the outskirts who welcomes Runners to her home, who in turn aids her in fitting in amongst the Gothman people.  Instead of her protective garb, Tara's soon wearing flowing dresses and attempting to act demure, all while seething over the injustice of being a second class citizen.  It isn't until she uses an advanced weapon that Lord Darius's never seen before while saving his younger brother from bullies that Tara comes to his attention.  As an unclaimed woman he has the right to take her if he so chooses, but he bides his time and watches her instead - admiring the differences between her and the Gothman women.  Oh yes, Darius is well aware that Tara is the Runner who's snuck into Gothman territory, what he doesn't know is that she's the daughter and heir to the leader of the Blood Circle Clan.  Love won't come easy as they challenge each other over and over - and with threats from the Sea People on the horizon it's going to take an ingenious approach and acceptance between the two mighty nations to bring about a solution that will unite them as allies.Forget everything you've ever known about political correctness, equality, and your perceptions of right and wrong.  In CLAIMING TARA Laurie Fitzgerald throws out all the rules and completely reinvents society in stunning clarity that's as engrossing as it is shocking.  Tara's got this strength of character that really grabs your attention, especially when she's faced with the superiority complexes of the Gothman males.  At first Lord Darius comes off as overwhelmingly demanding and unwilling to accept change but with Tara he seems more adaptable and even interested in life outside Gothman territory.  I loved how Darius and Tara challenge each other and even their lovemaking serves a coming together or two warring cultures.  CLAIMING TARA is a wonderful read that really opens up your imagination so I'd suggest dumping any women's lib sensitivities and preconceived notions about what an `ideal future' for the world might be and just hop on and enjoy the ride.  Tara certainly seems to do just that in every respect - whether it's her bike, Darius or just an unforeseeable future.The next book in this sweeping futuristic saga, TARA'S REVENGE, releases in February 2014 - and there will be many more to follow so be sure to check out Ms. Fitzgerald's website and/or sign up for her newsletter to keep informed.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies) </p>

 <p> It sounded so interesting, but wordscannot describe how disappointed I am in this books. While reading a rather convoluted prologue, I discover there are 10 books in this series. Spoiler* he cheats on her after she gives him children and we get NO explanation why. Will not be reading this author again. </p>

 <p> It started out interesting then started getting a little slow and boring in the middle I couldn't believe that Darius betrayed Tara I was so mad I wanted her to kill him but guess she was too nice to do that after that happened I was just mad the for the rest of the story I felt like she let him off to easily it made her look weak to me even tho she was such a strong character but the way she handled the situation with him after what he did pissed me off over all it was a good and interesting story I just don't like when the hero is not a great heroI would not recommend this book I actually removed it from my kindle I was in a bad mood all day after reading it </p>

 <p> I liked the first few chapters, it was going at a very good pace, nice characters ( especially Tara) and I liked the whole idea of runners and other cultures and then.....*spoilers* and then this book became a drama of all sorts ,she gets pregnant (with twins )but still wants to be a part in the war(silly) ,then after having the babies he had a funny way of showing his love by cheating on her (never explained why ), she leaves him claiming she will never forgive him EVER,then blah blah happens and she returns and guess what?? She forgives him ,and they act like nothing ever happened..after that everything just made me roll my eyes ..read this to the end and not planning on getting the second one .i can't recommend this book..sorry. </p>

 <p> The story is amazing.  So often even in a very enjoyable read you just kind of know what is coming around the next turn of the page.  This story caught me off guard more then once.  I felt ill at times and laughted and cried.  Great read.  I would recommend reading and would love to read more about the characters of Nuworld. </p>

 <p> I was very impressed with 'NUWORLD: Claiming Tara' by Laurie Fitzgerald. And while I usually try not to give away spoilers in a review, I don't think that will be strictly possible with this book.Nuworld is what remains of Earth and humanity more than a millennium after an apocalyptic event. The peoples are self-segregated and these groups have defined their own unique laws, traditions and prejudices - some of them rather harsh (at least considering the freedoms enjoyed in our current day and age) - and outsiders are looked upon with mistrust and suspicion at the least.Two of these groups are the main focus in this first book - the Runners (similar to Gypsies, except all Runners are trained as warriors, both male and female) and the Gothman (the men are the protectors and the women have no rights whatsoever). The heroine, Tara (headstrong, fearless, opinionated and an excellent warrior) is a Runner. Per Runner tradition, she is on her Age of Searching, which is like a personal quest for knowledge and understanding of the world. She has decided to learn about the Gothman, even though Runners are not welcomed in Gothman lands. Darius (arrogant, egotistical, domineering, strong and cold-bloodedly ruthless) is the Lord of Gothman. When these two characters meet, the sparks begin to fly.This story was non-stop action from the get go and it sucked me in and pulled me along for the ride. It's not too often that I read a book that has me yelling at the characters and their actions - literally questioning their intelligence (among other things) regarding some of the decisions they make - but 'NUWORLD: Claiming Tara' did just that.Ms, Fitzgerald has created a thought-provoking glimpse of a possible (probable?) future and I can't wait to read the next installment of the saga. </p>

 <p> Really disappointed with the direction the story took about half way through the book.  It started off really well, with a very interesting plot, a creative vision of the future, and good writing. However, the romance aspect of the book takes a nose dive and never recovers.  The cause of this nose dive and the subsequent reactions to it made me seriously dislike all of the main characters.  Wound up skimming the last half of the book just to see what would happen, mostly because I paid for it.  Won't be reading the next book, especially after seeing some of the reviews posted by other customers.  I haven't been this angry about an event in a book in a while, so there you go.  Tara is a kick ass young woman who lowers her standards because of her libido. Don't want to spoil anything, but although they say forgiveness is divine, at what point are you just the door mat. </p>
