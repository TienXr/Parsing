 <p> i just finished watching this collection this evening and i was really surprised at how it drew me in from the first episode. i had NO idea it was going to be so in-depth and parallel so many things we ponder about. i felt it was a very well-balanced anime in terms of serious-ness, drama, humor, etc...character development was great for all the characters! noone was left out with their stories and how they ended up in and after the last episode. i had read a review somewhere else that this was not a very good anime, lacked in "reality" but i have NO idea where they got that from. i highly recommend this one. </p>

 <p> No sci-fi fan should overlook this title, no matter if they are an anime afficianado or not.  Superb characterization and excellent voice acting lend to a likeable cast of characters.  While this is not your one series, one plot style of anime, the stand alone style of the episodes works well for this series.  My particular favorite involves a group of wanna-be ninjas living in a colony on the moon.  It sounds odd...and it is, but it is hilarious nonetheless.  What better than a shuriuken attack using not a metal ninja star, but a very small man contorted into a ninja star shape?  I guess you have to see it to believe it!The show sports some of the finest animation to date.  Though the music is not very lively or dramatic, it works well enough.Do not blow this off as a comedy though, there are great moments of sadness, conflict, despair, and suspense.  A sure classic that is unfortunately going to be widely overlooked in the US due to the 'Space debris collection' job the characters are employed in and the lack of excitement generated by it.  What a loss for those who do not view this gem. </p>

 <p> Planetes is one of the greatest anime series of all time, and easily falls in my top 5 favorites. Everyone kept telling me to watch it, and when I finally did it surpassed my expectations, which were high to begin with.Story: 10/10-This is really a slice-of-life anime, meaning each episode tells the story of what happens to the characters as they live their lives and pursue their dreams. However, there are stories that weave in and out of the series, so plot isn't entirely absent.The setting is outer space. Its the future, and mankind has developed ways of traveling easily through space. People live on the moon. You can take a trip on a rocket. The boundaries are endless! Ah, but this creates unexpected problems. Junk is floating around in the starry darkness. And if this garbage were to collide with a traveling ship, disaster would strike.Enter the Debris section. Under-payed, unnoticed, their job is to head out into the silence and quickly collect the dangerous trash before it causes problems.And there you go. That's the story, for the most part.Characters: 9999999/10-The best characters I've ever seen in an anime series. Everyone in the show is perfect. They all have their quirks, their likes and dislikes, their fears, and their pasts. Each one moves differently, has a unique personality, and has been elegantly created. As I watched I was amazed at how involved I was becoming. Their stories, their dreams, it all makes for a must-watch experience. The characters alone are enough to merit purchasing the series. Perfect.Music: 10/10-The music is superb and helps create the images of space in a way we don't usually see. It also helps create tension when our characters are floating around up there. There isn't any sound in space, so its just the characters and the music. Very brilliant, and very realistic.Animation: 10/10-Gorgeously drawn. The art rivals even Miyazaki's work, and gives a Studio Ghibli film a run for its money. Each detail can be seen, and the movement of it all is fluid. I was especially fond of the Zero G sequences. Its all realistic, and you can tell the creators of the show really did their research to try and create something noteworthy and honest.English Dub: 10/10-Its a fantastic dub. Tanabe might be a little high pitched sometimes, but its simply part of her charm. The dub is even better than some anime movies I've seen. Very nice.Overall: 9999999/10Watch it. Stop reading my review and get Planetes! You really need to, because its one of the greatest ever created, and will hold that position for many years to come. With perfect characters, an exciting and foreign setting, catchy music, humor, romance, suspense, unemployed ninjas, and good replay value, Planetes is one of the best anime around and easily one of my top 5...no, make that top 3 favorites. Its the anime series you can show to your friend who isn't familiar with the genre.Rating: 13 and up-Mostly accurate, though some material is even harsher than a PG-13 rating. There's plenty of language, smoking, and adult material. Violence is brief but painfully realistic and sometimes bloody. There is some sexual humor, and a few shots of a naughty magazine. Some scenes are edgy and might be uncomfortable to watch. I'd recommend the show to only those mature enough to handle it, maybe 15 and up. If it were a live-action movie it would be a harsh PG-13, possibly even R. </p>

 <p> Ive been watching anime for over 20 years. Ive seen most of the cliches n redundant themes that tend to reoccur each season.  In desperation, I decided to purchase Planetes bc the desciption of debri collectors in space seemed originally unique.  Theres quite a level of character development and how certain individuals mature throughout the series.  Socioecomic complications have great influence which provide an interesting, yet plausible, notion about humanities perspective about space exploration/escavation.  Depleted resources on earth, which is a real life occurence, could jetisen the modern day "space rush". Top five anime series on my list. </p>

 <p> I'll definitely say this was an interesting series and I did end up enjoying it overall.  At first it felt like the characters would really get on my nerves, but as I got into them more they got less annoying to me.  Or maybe because of what they went through they got less annoying in the show.  Either way, by the end of this series I was hooked and wanted to see what happened to them!Planetes has a very unique premise in my opinion and the show works a lot more like a sitcom rather than action or a straight drama at first.  A lot of the comedic factors are based on character personalities and how they deal with each other.  This is usually based around arguing.  The tension is based around their jobs, every day life, and what to do in emergencies.  In Planetes we follow a group of interstellar garbage collectors.  Apparently the garbage situation around Earth has gotten so bad that they need special groups called "debris haulers" to clean up space.  Things in space can be moving really fast, even debris like a small screw, and if it hits a passenger liner in just the right spot it could blow a hole right in the ship!  Unfortunately being a debris hauler is kind of a thankless job and this show takes place in a time when humanity is really just starting to expand into space.  There are a few large space stations that house people full time and there are couple of moon colonies, but there isn't much beyond that, so humanity's reach hasn't gone too far yet.The story really centers on a young girl named Ai Tanabe who gets her first job in space as a debris hauler.  Some people might not like the way these astronauts kind of trivialized the profession, but if you think about it, once space travel becomes more of the norm and people living in space also becomes the norm, it's very reasonable to believe that concepts like inept middle management like we see on Earth are bound to follow!  So that's sort of the world Tanabe gets involved with.  The two managers of the debris section for the Technora Co. are kind of clueless middle managers.  The real people with the know how are the grunt workers that Tanabe will be working with.  It's kind of a spin off of office sitcoms, but in space.  However, the show does have its serious moments, especially when the reality of dealing with upper management sets in.  Greed and power are not gone now that humanity is in space.  Not to mention there is a terrorist faction out there that wants to stop humanity from spreading into space!  So while this series seemed to start off as a happy comedy it takes a drastically serious turn towards the end.  I at first thought it would be marketed towards the fairly young, but by the end I can confidently say that it gets very adult themed or at least more mature like mid to late teenage years.The overall message is an overly sappy one about love, but the anime goes through dark enough trials that I can kind of forgive this kind of a closing.  There are a lot of messages that go beyond that of finding those who love you and this makes this anime even more worthwhile.  One that I particularly liked was the tangent on following your dreams.  Are you doing them on a realistic level, is it just an ideal, and are you afraid if you don't achieve them?  These kinds of concepts kind of hit home to me, but I really did like seeing the character deal with those issues.  I can't pinpoint where the show precisely changed from what appears to be a comedic sitcom to a deep drama, but it does happen.  That may sound like a poor writing technique, but I think Planetes pulled this off well.  It also allowed for some serious twists and turns that I never even could have guessed!In the end the story has its very cheerful and hopeful moments amidst large amounts of tragedy that befall people.  I like this very realistic approach, because it's not all happy fantasy out in space.  It gives that touch of reality that not everyone in the world is benevolent and sometimes people just get lost.  The harsh reality is that people do die and sometimes it's at the consequence of wanting to progress.  Even in Planetes the human race is already looking beyond the moon and wants to harvest energy on Jupiter!  So there's always a push for progression.  So this is a pretty enjoyable series overall.  It didn't blow me away and I wouldn't say this is the greatest thing I've ever seen, but it certainly did entertain me while I watched it.  This is the first one I've watched that Bandai put out and I have to say that I'm a little less than impressed with the packaging.  I like it in the sense that it definitely saves room because it's in a single oversized DVD case which houses all six discs.  However, the quality of the products that Funimation and ADV put out are just better in my opinion.  And for the other Bandai products I have there is also no booklet at all and I really like the ones I have that come with a booklet.  Maybe it's just me, but I just think the other companies put out a better product.  Either way, that really doesn't detract from the real quality of the show! </p>

 <p> Although I did not purchase this particular set whole, I have watched the 6-set series and was quite impressed with the storyline.  Pretty interesting idea and although some portions are a bit sci-fi-ish, its got a really good base.  If you enjoy seeing am movie with pretty decent characters who have variety of interests, hopes, dreams and motives...you can find that all here.  There were a few dragging pieces, but overall the whole series is very good. </p>

 <p> Science Fiction That Resembles Science Fact </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Sometimes an anime story comes along that manages to push exactly the right combination of buttons to appeal to nearly everyone.  Planetes is an example of this most rare and thoroughly enjoyable experience.  If you know nothing about this program the premise may seem a bit, um unimpressive in its rather narrow scope of vision.  The concept of Planetes centers on junk- no, really- space junk to be exact.  As the second half of the 21st century witnesses a humanity capable of traveling and living in space, debris that we left behind to eternally orbit the Earth has become a serious safety hazard.Just like the men today who come around to collect our refuse from garbage cans on the street side curb each week, so too does the garbage zipping around the planet require human beings for the task of collection and disposal.  Enter our lead characters, a group of very unique individuals who come together in the stuffy office space of a large orbiting space station with the common goal of ridding the solar system of man-made debris, one piece at a time.If the prose sounds a bit under-whelming, take heart in the fact that following along against this seemingly menial job in the grand scheme of things is perhaps the show's greatest strength.  The viewer is treated to a near-endless succession of interesting, realistic science fiction but as only the backdrop to the monotony and routine of a futuristic daily job.  Additionally the interaction between the lead cast is incredibly accurate and lifelike thanks to the fact that the nature of their jobs is established early on in terms of social status.  Pilots, managers, and just about anyone else in the organization seem to look down on the lowly debris collectors (in fact labeling the whole unit Half-Section) despite the fact that without them, space travel would be severely stifled.The true beauty of Planetes lies simply in its realistic interpretation of the near future and a painstaking attention to small detail.  The gains made in space travel are near science-book accurate for the setting of the year 2075.  Yes, humans travel into space via pressurized aircraft (not unlike a beefed up version of a jumbo jet) and enter into pre-established orbits from there.  Sure the average person can take a vacation to the lunar surface, but it's still a four-day trip to the moon just like it is for astronauts today.  More impressive still is that the moon's distance to the planet earth is chillingly accurate as viewed from the lunar surface.  So often in fiction, the moon is portrayed as a celestial body just above the clouds.  Add the fact that earth appears a distant blue sphere from the moon's surface to the four-days travel time (at speeds of 18,000 miles per hour) and the scope of the galaxy starts to look dauntingly immense (just like it really is).Another beautiful little scientifically correct touch is the fact that all of the external space shots are devoid of sound (since sound is after all, vibrations carried through air).  Every space scene doesn't feature a panoramic backdrop of perfectly twinkling distant stars either.  Sun light reflected from the earth's (or moon's) surface often drowns out such views in favor of simple silent blackness.The level of technical detail is exceptional and impressive, making this one of the best of science fiction series of all time and is rivaled only by the interesting character development in the foreground.  The story focuses on Tanabe, a nave and idealistic rookie debris collector, and her budding love interest in the almost comically cynical Hachirota (who has more names than a phone book).The high point of the show is the inner office political strains as some of the work-environment struggles take cues from classic pop-culture staples The Office and Office Space.  Couple that to a chief who knows he's useless, a die-hard temp-worker, a tough, chain smoking, and yet oddly attractive female pilot, and you have the formula for some solid interaction dynamics.Pacing is nearly perfect as well with several episodes that are deliberately uneventful.  As such, this is truly a show that only the Japanese could have done so delicately.  American studios would have littered the prose with unnecessary action, drama, or futuristic technology (worm-holes, hyperdrives, and so on).  Instead, Planetes blends a realistic daily grind and realistic space travel with the type of awkward romance that American children experience at around the age of 12.  It may not sound like much, but somehow it works very well.Unlike most anime, the look and shading of the characters is particularly unique.  The colors aren't especially vivid or bright but rather earth-toned and subdue which works well with the drab backdrop of life within a space station.  Those accustomed to giant, glassy eyes may be surprised to find much more realistically proportioned (and dare I say Asian) peepers here.Like most Bandai Anime Legends collections, the set is a bit light on extras but makes up for this by offering up the entire show across 6-discs for a great price.  My only complaint about Planetes is that the show comes to an end.  Concluding the 26th episode had me wishing for another 26. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> While this series doesn't have the action filled mecha battles its overall storyline and characters more than make up for it,  what surprised me was the creators who made this series did another one called Infinite Ryvius a series that was greatly disappointing for me so I was amazed that this one was a full 120 for me.  The animation feels reminiscent a little of the movie Akira or the Princess Monononoke not actually the same but if you've seen either movie you'll probably feel a sense of deja vu as well.  The voice cast for the dubbed and subbed were done very well which is no surprise since this is one of Bandais earlier series to come out unlike the ones that have been released in the last two years or so with a much more disappointing and less experienced and talented dubbed cast.  The series runs the gambit of genres for the most part not to strong in the series but enough,  if you're expecting a straight fast forward action sci-fi anime you will be disappointed a little as the series tries to give all the characters enough background that they won't feel like cameo additions or something.  The series won't be for everyone but if you like the drama series with great characters and a enjoyable storyline or like space animes here's a very underrated and overlooked series right here.... </p>

 <p> I didn't know what to expect when I found out that this program was about the day to day lives of debris haulers, working in orbit to keep the spacelanes safe for traffic, but I was knocked out by this show.  And on the edge of my seat right till the end.Ai Tanabe, a plucky, awkward girl comes to Technora Co. Debris Section full of youthful idealism, and is immediately paired with Hashirota Hoshino, a proud, resentful young man, and  the bulk of the story is tied to Tanabe's loss of innocence about the realities of life in space and Hashirota recapturing his.What's wonderful is how the world of 207? is fleshed out, from the culturelessness of the Lunar colonies, to the terrorist threat of those opposed to the expansion of humanity into the solar system, and the ethical questions of progress while third world countries still languish in poverty.  It gives a sense of REAL people and problems following in the wake of a technological rush forward, and emphasizes that acceptance and tolerance are what's really at stake. And that everything we do affects someone else.Hard to nail this show down exactly, you just have to see it. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Planetes is one of the greatest drama series ever created, though you might not think so from it's outward appearance. In this age of information, western audiences scream for ever greater realism, grittiness, and violence, focusing on sacrifice and suffering and at the same time forgetting the purpose that it serves. The world of animation, and particularly the animation pouring out of Japan in a raging torrent, is largely popular for it's flash and not for it's substance, despite the fact that substance is there in ample quality for the discerning viewer.And where does Planetes come in? Planetes is an anime with the styling of a realistic Western Drama, a Realistic Epic set in the not-too-distant future that focuses on the people, their sacrifice, their world, and greater ideals and yearnings that it serves.You could say that Planetes (which is Greek for Wanderers) is simply a story about astronauts in space collecting debris garbage. But this show is SO much more than that.The first time I saw this show, I was very off-put by the first episode, as it starts out like so many anime, with Japanese quirkiness and awkwardness, but very quickly hints at something far greater. From the very first episode we are shown a world of great ideals and dreams, of righteous beliefs just under the surface of the unfair world if only you can look for it. Throughout the show this same theme resonates again and again, being attacked but never thwarted by the never-ending cruelty of reality. It takes many forms, from from not wanting to destroy a peace plaque to protect a satellite of war, to helping people from a tiny third-world country test their space suit and get it certified for space-worthiness even as the world government seizes the country and it's representatives in space.While the heart-touching (and at times heart-wrenching) ideals keep coming up, it's the characters who embody these choices of practical vs.idealistic conflict that give the show it's heart. Almost every major character in the show gets character development time, showing why they are the way that they are. As their stories unfold before our eyes and we gain insight into their feelings, we come to identify with and sympathize with their feelings. I can think of no better example of this then the Russian astronaut's story wherein (spoiler alert) we learn of the death of his dear wife, and how one small trinket she had on her when she died drives him to search through the debris of space endlessly to find the message written inside. When he finally finds the item (a compass) and sees the message inside, I think it was one of the most profound moments of any drama I had ever seen. Have you ever had a premonition of tragedy to come, have you ever wished for the safety and happiness of someone you love? Have you ever had to move past losing a person you love to live life again? Such was the struggle of a single character in a single episode!There are many subplots which continue simultaneously, from the idealistic astronaut's arguing and (spoilers again) eventually love for the seemingly cynical rough talking astronaut (who despite all appearances is actually just as idealistic as she is) to the struggle between the terrorists seeking to destroy all space travel and the world government taking advantage of small nations. And as the series progresses, you may find yourself, like me, wondering just where it is going. Rest assured, while it may seem to derail toward the end, destiny pushes events to a head, and ultimately toward one of the most satisfying conclusions to any anime I can recall.I could talk about the dramatic music, the historical opening, the pastel colored highly-detailed animation, the incredible realism (no sound in space!), the superb voice-acting in the Japanese dub, the INCREDIBLE drama in the final episodes (the most dramatic moment in any television show I have seen comes in an episode where the main protagonist is stranded on the moon with a terrorist, and has the choice of stealing her air, or dying a horrible death from oxygen starvation {watching the seconds tick down as she stares at the oxygen tanks, flashes of everything she has ever said about love and sacrifice playing through her head had me worked up more than I can ever remember being from a TV show}). Really though, any fan of serious animated drama, or just drama in general owes it to their self  to give this show a watch. It was undoubtedly the greatest show produced that year, and one of the best anime I have ever seen. The world would be a better place if more people watched shows like Planetes. </p>

 <p> This series is a technically realistic vision of working folk in a space faring Earth society.The characters are true to life and the situations are what you'd expect from Human society of 2070.Anyone with an interest in space and space technology should have this series.The storyline is your basic one of love and relationships with space being a backdrop. It's a drama but there's enough humor in it to keep things from getting too heavy.This DVD release is the complete series with many extras. The soundtracks are the original Japanese and a very good English dub. Subtitles are accurate to the Japanese soundtrack.The extras are spread throughout the disks and include bits of the manga, commentary as presented by one of the characters (in comic manga form), interviews with the creative staff, promos and alternative opening sequences.My only gripe on this release is the interview with the creative staff is not subtitled.All in all a must have for the anime/space enthusiast and a welcome relief from giant robots shooting each other. </p>
