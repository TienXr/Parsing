<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This movie had a shocking theme.  Kidnapping a Hispanic post-teen brother and sister in Mexico, and forcing them to perform sex, while the kidnappers videotaped the act. Then the siblings are returned, unharmed, to resume their lives. They never know their kidnappers, or see them again, or the sex tape. But the experience destroys their bonded relationship.  Verrrrry titilating topic, and somewhat graphic in two short scenes, but then the movie slowly dies, having used-up its shock value in one or two 5 minute scenes.  The topic had immense potential, but it never amounted to much after the graphic scenes. We expect the siblings to snap-back to loving and caring for one another, but just the opposite happens. They avoid one another, until the sister marries, and moves away.  Not a "Family" movie. And don't watch it with your sister either, unless you are trying to put thoughts in her head. The end of the movie, the intention is to notify the viewer that this practice of kidnapping Females, Siblings, or Children in Mexico for enrichment in the Porno Industry, is not uncommon. Whether it is, or not, I cannot say. But the movie was adequate enough to demonstrate the issue. </p>

 <p> I love movies.  I love foreign language films (with original subtitle tracks, no stupid dubbing). I know a good movie when I see it. This isn't one.I saw this film without ever having heard of it or knowing what it was about, and boy do I wish I had beforehand, then maybe I would've skipped it. The basic premise is that Daniel and Ana, brother and sister, are kidnapped by a group of idiot pornographers (who are stupid enough not to wear masks to hide their faces) and force the siblings to have sex on camera. The film then follows the psychological effects of both siblings.That in itself might make for a great documentary, but this film, even if it's based on true events, sucks. It tries so very hard to be edgy and deep and shocking and it just sucks. Mulholland Drive makes more sense than this movie.First off, the kidnappers aren't threatening at all. You never get the sense they're actually going to commit murder if these kids don't do what the kidnappers command them to. Then, as I mentioned, the kidnappers don't wear masks. I thought maybe they would later be identified and arrested, but nope, that would run the risk of making this film interesting, which it goes out of its way to not do.Don't get me wrong, the psychological effect of this terrible event does play out with a kind of uncomfortable tension, but the movie is just so ridiculous at how things play out. Daniel literally spends the bulk of the film avoiding doing anything interesting, then towards the end he does something terrible that's obviously meant to shock you because it makes no sense otherwise. I don't need a happy ending, but that doesn't mean I'll let a crappy unresolved ending slide by.There are no likable characters in this film. Even the two victims, thanks to the shoddy storytelling, become very unlikable by the end (one by their actions, the other by their inactions).I can't even remember the last time a film made me feel this angry or this stupid for actually having sat through it. And it's not like the trashy Hollywood CGI films or Michael Bay movies that I can make fun of because the subject matter is so dead serious.There are so many much more meaningful foreign language films out there, don't was 95 minutes of your life on this one. </p>

 <p> It's a re-enactaction based on true events. There is a grave; stark simplicity to this film that makes no bones of a rape between a brother and  sister and how they deal with their private trauma after. There are  enough of the details to make perfect sense. To sensationalise is to disgrace. The background to the film is her wedding which is ironic because it's the joining of two people as they Should be.That the  deed in this film and it's would be consequences has occurred  for sport and profit and will in future is without doubt. The film is a chilling warning......so now you know..... </p>

 <p> This movie deals with a dark side of life I've never even thought about.  It was a powerful subject and a disturbing one.  To me, this is the mark of a well made movie - whether or not it made you stop and think; whether or not it made you feel strongly about it; whether or not it stirred your emotions.  This movie did that for me. </p>

 <p> This movie,stated as based on true events, is more like a Telemovie with little budget.Viewing it for the first time, without knowing the actual motive for the kidnapping and crime, one is left wondering for most of the duration just why did it happen and what is going to be the outcome.The after events seem almost not in keeping with what has happened.You would expect that at least the police and parents would be involved, but no, just an awkward complication regarding a future marriage and another seemingly strange out of character event.The notes at the end of the movie finally suggest what the motive was and this is an important issue, but this movie needed a much better script and director to let it have impact. </p>

 <p> This movie shows a brother and sister forced to have sex with each other at gunpoint.  Not only are they depressed and confused after it's over, but life as they knew it will be more or less over.  Nothing will ever be quite normal again.  It makes you wonder what unspeakable experiences other people are silently carrying on their backs.  If I could go back in time, I would skip this movie, even though it's thoughtfully and sensitively told. </p>

 <p> Some good acting and I am sure this could and does happen. It would be a brother and sister's worse nightmare, they are kidnaped and forced to do things that is unforgiven a little hard to watch. </p>

 <p> Daniel & Ana is named after the wealthy siblings Daniel and Ana Torres. Daniel attends high school as Ana prepares for her wedding. Daniel tentatively moves forward with his girlfriend. His biggest concern is not owning a car. Ana's problem is that her fiance Rafa has been offered a job in Spain. He wants to take the job; she wants to remain in Mexico City with her family. Then three men kidnap the brother and sister and sexually assault them in a way that makes them feel especially culpable. They are released physically unharmed but in a state of complete shock.The acting is excellent, especially by Marimar Vega as the sexy and confident Ana. The scene in which she and Daniel are kidnapped is chilling and graphic. The also beautiful Dario Yazbeck Bernal successfully conveys Daniel's vulnerability. However, though their initial paralysis is portrayed with painstaking realism, the audience sees absolutely no line between the initial assault and Daniel's eventual actions. His later reaction comes across as unbelievable and sensationalistic. The clueless parents are not at fault, but they are pushed to the background and thus not particularly sympathetic.Clinically shot and scored with overplayed bits of classical music, this attempt to raise awareness about coerced victims of pornography is ostensibly a true story. Unfortunately, this tale of close siblings forced apart is more disturbing than moving, thanks to muddy psychology. </p>

 <p> Daniel & Ana, for me, is not an "entertaining film." As many films are, it's a window. This window, though open, is one that almost made me feel guilty for peering through, especially because it's based on a true story. Lots of films are filled with painful information. It's the way the story in Daniel & Ana swirls onscreen that hurts so much - a slow, silent, intimate look, so much more disturbing than quick, violent quakes. In an effort to avoid a spoiler, I will say that I'm glad I saw the film. The acting, directing, production and cinematography were excellent. I'm a film buff. Of all the movies I have seen, this is definitely one that children nor teens should watch. </p>
