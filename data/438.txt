 <p> While some of the words are challenging for new readers, overall my 5 year old daughter loved being able to read the book to me. All the cute bunny pictures kept her engaged. The Kindle version works well. </p>

 <p> This is a very simply book for 1-2 year old children. It was ok and my son liked looking at it for a little while but soon became bored with it. </p>

 <p> This book was super CUTE!! My kids loved the content, ryming and graphics. I base my reviews on the total package, and I always try to be fair. First I look at content and what my kids actually said about the book. I also judge a book by its cover and graphics. I see plenty of books on Kindle with great content and okay graphics and sometimes I see books with super cover graphics and sub-par content. You did a GREAT job with this book! 5 STARS! GREAT content and GREAT graphics too. :) I told my children I would buy more of your books. </p>

 <p> Pictures of a variety of rabbits which was what I liked and was expecting.  There is a little bunny on each page to find.  The idea is good but it is not hidden too cleverly. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Pictures are very good. </p>
