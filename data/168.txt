 <p> The sound is funny in some places. It's a sad movie. There is a lesbian rape scene. Lots of young wayward girls to see though. This girl was also in the Exorcist. </p>

 <p> Why didn't Capt. Freaky remember this lackluster lame "tv movie" from back in 1974?  The big deal supposedly was the shower scene where Linda Blair gets violated by four other inmate girls who ram the wooden handle of a plunger into her...lots of fake screaming....You see nothing of Miss Blair in this implied rape scene.They put "NR" and "uncut" on the outside of the packaging so that stupid idiots (like me) buy it hoping to see some violent action on a female prisoner....alas....I recommend you save your $7 bucks and buy something else.  There has to be better women in prison movies than this one....Usually those old 1970's Nazi SS films about women in prison are more sexually gratifying than this piece of contrived TV doo-doo... </p>

 <p> The movie borders on sexploitation but without being overtly so.  I've always loved Linda Blair.  She is definitely worth watching in a Lolita sort of way. </p>

 <p> No one mentions the other inmates of the juvenile asylum, but the young actresses playing Denny and Moco are scarily effective, and Tina Andrews, the young girl playing Josie(who can also be seen as one of Marcia Brady's school-friends in the 'Davy Jones' episode on 'The Brady Bunch' as well as a student in 'Conrack'), gives a tightly-controlled performance; when her mother comes for a visit, Josie cries, mocking her: 'When ya comin' home? I miss you, Josie'." That's good acting. As for Linda Blair: she's always reliable and solid, but here it takes her a little while to warm up. In the admissions office near the beginning, Linda is a bit too somnambulistic("I don't think I need to be here"), but minutes later, when she has discovered her father brought her suitcase from home, Linda gets the juices going: "Who brought it? Why didn't you tell me he was here?" This is a wrenching moment. In this horrible place, with ugly walls and sterile decor, Chris is being jerked this way and that--and then come to find out, her own father was just there and didn't even want to talk to her. It's a powerful movie, and should touch anyone who's had a troubled youth. The low-budget, documentary quality of the movie was deliberate(it looked this way even on it's first TV airing), and the DVD will only enhance its 'dated' look, but at the time it was a ratings bonanza and made Linda Blair one of the highest paid actresses working in telefilms. Her next two, "Sarah T. Portrait of a Teenage Alcholic" and "Sweet Hostage" are even better than this one, but are, sadly, still in the DVD vaults. </p>

 <p> Too tame to be an exploitation film yet too violent and adult to be an ABC Afterschool Special, "Born Innocent" suffers from this middle-of-the-road stance.Cherub-faced Linda Blair (the Pia Zadora of the '70s and a then-hot-commodity due to her appearance in "The Exorcist") plays 14-year-old chronic runaway Christine Parker who is sent to a girls' reform school after her parents sign over their rights to the courts.The film looks promising when she first arrives (a resident eggs another girl on to "Hit her....hit her") and we meet the requisite lesbians and teenage hookers but this film never lives up to its potential.Another problem is that Blair doesn't have the ability to carry the movie and by the second half when we meet the parents and the teacher and warden get more screen time, it's too little, too late.The transformation of Linda's character from baby-faced innocent to hardened inmate is illustrated by the contrast of her carefree image on a swing to smoking cigarettes and carving her initials into her own flesh.The downbeat ending doesn't help the film, in which the teacher (whom all the girls refer to as "Mom" -- she's like a cross between Betty Buckley and Sandy Duncan) blubbers as she realizes she won't be able to "save" Linda/Christine.This movie has a reputation and cult following, probably due to the shower room scene where poor Linda is sexually assaulted with a broom handle while a gang of girls hold her down.But overall it's really a pretty dull affair. If you want something from the same era but much more fun and entertaining, check out 1973's "The Baby" starring Ruth Roman.I wouldn't recommend paying the high price this out-of-print DVD commands. Rent it instead. </p>

 <p> In this gritty and uncomprimising look at the violent and darkworld of girl's reform schools.Linda Blair gives her best screen performance as a frightened and all too trusting teen.Who deals with her father's abuse and her mother's drinking by running away.Eventually,"Chris Parker's"(Ms.Blair's)Parents have had enough of their daughter's supposedly uncontrollable behavior and the thoughless and neglegent pair send the poor girl to a juvenile insitutionfor teenage girls.Where Poor Ms.Blair is abused and raped by some of the dangerous and insane inmates and she recieves no mercy fromthe school's equally abusive and thoughtless housemother:"Mrs.Emma Lasko"(Allyn Ann McClaire..Best remembered for playinganother authoritative lout:"Mrs.Rubner"on the short lived:"TonyRandall Show").Yet?Ms.Blair's"Chris Parker"is not without at least one friend.A kindly teacher,who tries to get the young girl to improve her-self.So that she can impress the school officals to thepoint.Where she can go home for a brief visit and hopefullyshe can remain with her family.But once at home,"Chris"finds out that nothing has changed.Her father:"Ben Parker"(played by the late Richard Jakel..bestremembered as the obnoxious federal agent in the movie versionof"Starman")is still an abusive and vicious lout.Who feels that her daughter belongs in that school and that hehas done nothing wrong..that he is  not reasonsible for her daughter's difficulty in staying home and the mother(played byMs.Kim Hunter.."Dr.Zeria"in "The Planet Of The Apes"movies)canonly deal with her husband's mean sprirted attitude by reachingfor the bottle."Chris"heads for Tucson,in the hopes that she can find refugewith her brother(played by Mitch Vogel..Best remembered as"JamieHunter Cartwright"on"Bonannza!").Sadly.."Chris"finds out that her brother doesn't care and she returns to the school.Where shebecomes an angry and distrustful cynic.The plot is good and the acting is top notch.Ms.Blair's performance is real and heartfelt..especially.When she meets her brother at the bus stop..only to find outthat the unfaifthful creep has turned her in to the cops.Ms.Jakel's performance as "Mr.Parker"is also riveting.As he goes from overbearing nice guy to violent and unreasonablerage.There are also some fine performances from The actors..whoplay the girls in the schools and from the lady.Who plays thesupportive teacher.Even Ms.McClaire's role of the bullyinghousemother is worth watching.(Ms.Hunter's role is small but still worth watching)The one scene that is brilliantly filmed(But hard to watchby very young children and by those..whose  strict morals and weakhearts have trouble viewing this scene)is the scene .Where Ms.Blair's character is raped in the shower room bythe more dangerous inmates of the insitution.The scene ,while well executed is still difficult for some peopleto watch and should not be seen by very young children.Despite the negitive outcome of this scene(and I'm not asbadly effect by the rape scene as some other viewers of thisfilm are?)"Born Inocent!"is  Ms.Linda Blair's best tv performance!Bravo Ms.Blair! </p>

 <p> While serving time in the U.S. Navy and having read the paperback, "The Exorcist" and seeing the movies, one of my favorite actresses included Linda Blair who is the star of "Born Innocent." I had never seen this made for TV movie before and wonder who may have actually seen it then. The movie causes one to think about relationships and why a runaway thinks anything is better than going back home when one of her parents won't give her a chance to straighten up and fly right. </p>

 <p> I was really lucky to be able to find a new copy of this movie on VHS.  I remember it well from it's first broadcast in 1974 on NBC, and all the controversy it generated due to [a rape] scene.  This scene was edited from reruns, but is in tact on video.  Linda Blair plays a teenage runaway that ends up in juvenile hall due to her parents request & constant running away.  It was made during an era on Network TV when they were trying to convey a message in the movies they broadcast.  The fashions, the hairstyles and the classic acting by Linda Blair, make this a must own for anyone that appreciates the classic made-for-tv movies of the '70s. </p>

 <p> Being a boy growing up in the 70's meant you had the hots for Linda Blair! After her breakthrough role as Regan in 'The Exorcist' Linda Blair was cast in a couple of TV films starting with 'Born Innocent' and then on to 'Sweet Hostage'. This film had a shocking and controversial scene of her being gang raped by a group of girls with a plunger! The scene is tame by today's standards, but it was something in the 70's especially in a TV movie.The film is pretty good by TV standard of the era and it's amazing that studio executives would allow a 14 year old girl to be subjected to such a thing on screen....I guess after she got her privates invaded by a holy cross in 'The Exorcist' a plunger was the next best thing!? The DVD transfer looks pretty good and there some bios for the main actor. The trailer extras for some low budget horror films are a hoot! </p>

 <p> Linda Blair, immediately following her triumph in ''The Exorcist'' was cast in this then controversial TV movie. Christine Parker is a young runaway from an abusive home whose parents hand her over to the state. She finds herself in a detention home, where she discovers the even harsher realities of the young girls who reside there - unloved, troubled, and angry, who have the tendency to vent all their aggression onto newcomers. She finds herself as the target of their rage on evening in the shower room, where five of her fellow inmates gang up on her and violate her with a toilet plunger handle. Considered overly graphic at the time of its original airing in 1974, the scene was cut for later airings, but has been restored on DVD. Blair's nipple can be briefly seen for a few moments and that may explain why the scene was cut in subsequent TV broadcasts. As disturbing as it is, the rape is essential to the film's plot and adds to the anguish that Chris and her peers experience. When she has the chance to go home for a brief stay, her abusive father (Richard Jaeckel, magnificent) slaps her and her mother, leading the teen to run away again, taking her right back to where she started. Kim Hunter is effective as the passive, meek mother who endures her husband's insensitivity and mistreatment. Blair went on to give some more great performances in the late 70s, such as another TV movie, "Sarah T: Portrait Of A Teenage Alcoholic" and the theatrical releases "Sweet Hostage", "Summer Of Fear" and "Hell Night". Not long after, she found herself in exploitation flick hell. She is an outstanding actress, giving her all to every project, and it would have been nice if she had found some more mainstream material. Joanna Miles as the compassionate teacher, is the voice of reason and perhaps of caring in a system that does not want to take a bigger step towards actually considering the welfare of these troubled youths. Allyn Ann McLerie, as the well-meaning but ineffectual housemother Lasko, conveys the frustration and defeatist attitude of a woman who keeps things together but can't bring herself to actually make a difference in the lives of her girls. The portrayals of the other adolescents are right on target, a diverse group who all share the same pain, so much so that they become bonded in a hardened, indifferent way. Chris becomes one of the gang, and in a sadly realistic conclusion, has lost sight of any goals or aspirations she may have had to change her life."Sarah T: Portrait Of A Teenage Alcoholic" and "Sweet Hostage" are long overdue for DVD releases.Worth viewing, still relevant today. </p>

 <p> I remember watching this made for tv movie in the early seventies and being really disturbed by it, in a good way. The only part I can cearly recall is Linda Blair getting gang raped in the shower. This would make a great double bill with that other classic made for TV movie: Don't Ask Alice. </p>
