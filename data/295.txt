<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Found Footage Gem </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> One of the best jobs I've seen of a slow build in the found-footage genre. Wonderful descent into the bleak, colorless world of an abandoned insane asylum. The acting is good, the special effects are minimal and used flawlessly, and there is a fair bit of nudity to boot! Yay! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Avoid it. </p>

 <p> Why do I do keep doing this to myself? I had no idea it was "found footage" until the very opening and it was, thereafter, all downhill. Uphill, really, as it was such an effort to keep my eyes open. This effort is peopled with cartoonishly nauseating individuals that you couldn't really care less about and, as far the tart leading the documentary crew into ever more contrived situations goes...better she had stayed home. Better for her career, that is.Awful, awful, awful dross that should be left on the shelf. Derivative and unrelentingly bad. Avoid it. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> REEL EVIL Is A Real Puzzle </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>
  01-15-2013  
<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> You know it: there's been a rash of found footage films that's been going on solidly for about a decade now.  I suppose each of them has something relevant to add to the phenomenon, but, at some point, I think it's increasingly difficult to find greater value in continuing a `found footage' project unless it posits to bring something fresh to the scene.  That's not an easy sell, mind you; in fact, I'd suspect that those kinds of projects are few and far between.  Still, without bringing something original to the format, is this truly a tale worth being told in this way (i.e. merely being a found footage motion picture)?With REEL EVIL, the results are a bit conflicted.(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Budding documentary filmmakers Kennedy (played by the fetching Jessica Morris), Cory (Kaiwi Lyman), and James (Jeffrey Adler) are hoping to get their big break in Hollywood when they respond to an advertisement seeking a film crew to shoot an official behind-the-scenes short for a studio horror film.  As luck would have it, they find more than they bargained for: the movie takes place inside a former psychiatric hospital - complete with its own sordid past - where they soon realize they can wander off and capture footage for their own project.  However, before the night is over, they're bound to unlock more secrets as they find themselves trapped in a never-ending maze ... and they're not alone.Yes - just to clarify - this is (yet) another found footage film, but I'll briefly try to explain why it, perhaps, shouldn't have been.See, the basic format of the found footage film builds itself around certain expectations for the delivery.  For example, `found footage' means just that - the footage is intended to be a mostly raw presentation of what took place or what happened to the central characters.  Furthermore, as the footage is intended to be presented in its bare bones format, there should be little if any evidence of post-production tinkering of any fashion because that - by definition - tends to interrupt the narrative flow of the `found' story.REEL EVIL, to its detriment, kinda/sorta veers off from the traditional `found footage' sub-genre of horror in several ways.  First, the story is cobbled together by several cameras - a few of which were independent from control of the main characters and, thusly, wouldn't have been part of the `found footage' phenomenon being captured by the crew.  The most prominent example of this is a scene captured by two minor characters on a cell phone; because this footage wasn't part of the end product being filmed by Kennedy, Cory, and James, it ends up reminding the audience that what it's watching IS a motion picture, not a found footage reel, directly.  This causes a break in the natural flow of the story (at least it did for me), producing the effect to pull me out of the story.  Even worse, however, was the fact that either scribe Shane Bitterling or director Danny Draven decided that a music soundtrack was required as part of the REEL EVIL experience; see, `found footage' films don't use soundtracks because, as I think I've tried to be clear, they are compilations of `found footage,' and they necessarily wouldn't have a pounding orchestral accompaniment.To the film's credit, there are several very good ideas and several very good scares at play here, so many that I think the film would've been better served to trash the whole `found footage' experience entirely and simply go with a traditional horror film.  In fact, some of the experiences might've worked better that way, and I think it would've opened up the story to more opportunity for some creative storytelling.  As it is, there are some legitimate `creeps' in there.  It would've been served up with more had Draven and company embraced a different format.REEL EVIL is produced by Full Moon Entertainment, and DVD distribution appears to have been handled by their subsidiary, Full Moon Direct.  As for the technical aspects, I'll have to admit that I find it increasingly difficult to appraise `found footage' films.  First, the sound is never the best (as that's part of the total package); second, the image is herky-jerky and sometimes hard to discern (as that's also part of the package); and, lastly, it's deliberately not all meant to look as prim and proper as regular theatrical releases.  So I'll leave it at this: I think it looks and sounds exactly as well as the director and producer wanted.  For disc enthusiasts, there's a wealth of special features, including a commentary track, some behind-the-scenes production shorts, a blooper reel, music video, and an assortment of trailers for related releases.  They certainly didn't skimp on the side dishes, and I'm sure there's something for everyone who's interested.2 and one-half stars.  RECOMMENDED.  It's a perfectly average experience that coulda/shoulda/woulda been better.  As scares go, it's a harmless way to spend 77 minutes.  Despite the fact that REEL EVIL tries to combine one genre with a sub-genre in it, there are plenty of sparks of inspiration in it, enough that I would've strongly recommended - were I in pre-production - to chuck the whole `found footage' aspect and focused on a traditional horror film.  While I can't predict the outcome, I'd honestly think it may've been better received by audiences.  The story meanders a bit in the second half when it's reduced to  little more than the lost crew trying to find their way out of the haunted hospital, and that needed tightening up in order to produce a cleaner production.  Otherwise, it delivers exactly what it promises: a found-footage flick with ghosts aplenty ... but it could've been something more.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Full Moon Features provided me with an advance DVD screener of REEL EVIL by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Horror Junkie's review: Very derivative, hovers between 2.5 and 3 for a true "its just ok" </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> If you've seen Grave Encounters (you must have) and Greystone Park (enjoyable though much criticized for being similar to GE), then you know this movie already. Now, I am NOT one of those critical snobs who will poo poo a movie because its thematic content is not wholly original. If that was a problem for me, then most of my slasher A list films, nevermind B list, would not have been made. Actually, that would be true of any subgenre, slasher or otherwise. So I am VERY grateful to those many movies that do not strive for originality but effectiveness because, thanks to them, I have stuff to watch.I guess what makes it hard to overlook the derivative quality here is the main characters. The secondary characters, those who our protags were going to record for their &#34;making of...&#34; documentary, were obnoxious on purpose and as such, funny and a breath of fresh air from the &#34;Controlling Dumb Beotch, with the Dumb and Dumber follower&#34; trio that comprised our protags. Seriously, this not being my first rodeo, if I were in a situation like this, with anyone who acted like that, I would be the first one to satisfy their death wish, waaay before the ghost, demon, serial killer, et al, would get a chance to. You are NOT going to take me down with your dumb butt. That being said... I don't normally criticize the &#34;stupid decisions&#34; made by many of our protags in these movies- and it irks me when others do- because, duh, if they didn't make those mistakes then there would be no movie! But these guys were just too annoying. So much so, I was glad when Dr. Evil came to visit. Except they were biref visitations and as such, didn't comprise much or enough of the film. The visuals, the horror effects, were fine actually. But having seen the aforementioned same but first movies, it wasn't enough to excite me. Pretty much a forgettable experience. Definitely not for primetime viewing. But if you have absolutely nothing else to watch, its not the bottom of the barrel. </p>

 <p> This movie kind of lost me for a while.  I don't have much to say about it but I did think the 3 main characters were pretty good, while the other crew.....not so much.  Camera work was a bit better on this than most and some pretty good jumps and screams the last portion of the film.  All in all, a solid 3, I just couldn't bring myself to go to a 4. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> NOT BAD... A SLIGHT TWIST FROM THE USUAL "FOUND FOOTAGE" FORMULA... </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> With the inundation of &#34;found footage&#34; films it's almost tempting to dismiss the entire genre as past its time... However, by doing so some may miss out on some interesting films. &#34;Reel Evil&#34; took the usual FF setting - an abandoned hospital/mental hospital - and gave it a slight twist (in this case, the filming of an actual movie). But lo and behold, the need to explore said hospital for a documentary was too much. Some slight scares. Not the worst of the genre, but neither the best. </p>

 <p> I know this movie was attacked but the positive things people have said are true. They do go around in circles at some point but not by choice. The best way to watch a found footage film is in the dark and with no expectations. Remember in theory it's real life not a movie. I like that they go exploring in the spooky building it kind of builds the tension. I did think the sound guy was kind of a wuss. And a bit pretentious, I had a hard time feeling sympathy with him. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great acting (for the most part), and that's it. </p>

 <p> I love found footage films, specifically because the acting is so raw and realistic, and this one is no exception. Everyone (except the female playing the actress) was authentic, solid in their range, and did a great job of drawing you into the story, so the movie gets two stars for that. Unfortunately, that's where the positives of this film end. The plot has been done before, (and much better, might I add, by 'Grave Encounters'), and the special effects are atrocious. All of the apparitions looked to have been made using Microsoft Paint and then placed into the film with no regards to realism, or how it would appear to the average person. Considering that movies of this nature rely heavily on how well the SFX is implemented, I must say that I was very disappointed by what I saw. Lastly, there are too many instances where absolutely nothing happens, or the actors are walking around in (literal) circles, and this becomes tedious really fast.The worst part of the film, however, is the gratuitous portrayal of breasts that seem to have been added to appease a mentality limited male audience. I counted 3 pairs of breasts, none integral to the story, and I actually rolled my eyes in annoyance at how the film-makers did not even attempt to hide the fact that they were sophomoric males whom have probably never seen a real naked female in their lives.It's sad, really; the talent is obviously there, the story (albeit cliched) held my interest and the real-life location was creepy as hell. It was the execution that really suffered, as the movie was more frustrating to watch than enjoyable. Avoid this, and give your movie to the better films out there that follow a similar formula (Grave Encounters and The Tunnel come to mind). </p>

 <p> No matter how bad a movie may be, it's rare for me to quit watching...but REEL EVIL is so familiar, so poorly done and sooooo boring I couldn't make it through the first 60 minutes, almost falling asleep.The acting is atrocious and the movie is almost exciting as watching paint dry.REEL EVIL is further proof that the "found footage" genre has overstayed its welcome!!! </p>

 <p> A group of documentarian's go into a haunted hospital and discover it really is haunted. Wow, it's the exact same story of Grave Encounters. Although I enjoyed this better than Grave Encounters, it still is one of those movies that could be a lot better if they would actually make a proper ending to the film instead of quickly getting it over and done with and hoping a sequel can be made. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Seen It All Before </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The plot was like so many horror movies that feature a camera crew of people who will get lost in a mental institution, run all over calling out names of their disappeared buddies, then we all get the truth. It's haunted with murderous spirits. Sound familiar? Okay, I admit that there were some spine tingling scenes, but not enough to bother giving this movie more than one star. The acting didn't require much but screaming and good physical condition to run all over a place where there was no escape. Advise that you not waste your money. </p>

 <p> I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?, </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This film is a new twist on old &#34;exploring the abandoned asylum for the criminally insane&#34; horror film. This one incorporates the found footage genre. In this production a film crew is hired to film a documentary on behind the scenes footage of a movie filmed at said asylum. What this gimmick does is to allow decent lighting as the main crew had set them up. This gives us a more professional looking found footage film.Kennedy(Jessica Morris)leads this group of daring film makers as they explore the abandoned establishment. You see occasional ghosts on the camera, but initially there are fewer ghosts than appear on my camera. After our heroes have a tussle with the main quirky film's director, demanding producer, primadonna actress and they explore for a bit, you are one hour into a 72 minute feature before the first scare.The film needed to be longer, cut out some of the build up, and extend the horror ending. I kept waiting for things to happen and when it did, it didn't show much and wasn't that scary.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Jamie Bernadette, Sandra Hinojosa, Becca Perrel) </p>
