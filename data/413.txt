 <p> I didn't have a problem with the subject matter, they loved each other and only had 24 years between them, so I thought that aspect was good (I'm making an effort to read more kink). But the execution, the writing, made me laugh...at it. After the first couple of pages of explanations, it seemed stilted and too contrived. I didn't connect with the characters one bit. Within the few pages, there were three mentions of Hank's 10 1/2 inches, lots of unnecessary exclamation points, and dialogue that sounded awkward. Maybe some people do speak like that, but for me those things just made this story farcical for me. </p>

 <p> Good idea, poor execution </p>

 <p> Other than the &#34;stinky&#34; balls and underwear, and the crude under the skin (yuk), it was a awesome story. I absolutely loved it. </p>

 <p> This story left me feeling conflicted.  I really felt like I was reading a story that was justifying pedophila.  I am bothered by Austin's naivety and I was disappointed by his treatment by his stepfather Hank. The story began with making us think that Hank really cared about Austin. When all along he was just biding his time until Austin became legal game and he could have him for himself and then he turned him into his slave for life.  I guess if you are into that sort of thing you might like this story.  So, I guess I'm not conflicted after all.  I really didn't like it.  It left a foul taste in my mouth and a quizzyness in my stomach. But, to each his own. But, I won't be reading the sequels to this story. </p>

 <p> I bought this on impulse, it's only 99 cents,  so what harm can there be?It's an odd, ugly story.  Austin's mother leaves one day,  deserting her 16 yo son and her boyfriend Hank (clearly and explicitly not his father)  Hank and Austin muddle along for 2 years but when Austin turns 18,  Hank introduces a new idea...  that Austin should be his substitute wife.  Hank kept calling Austin's anus his 'pussy hole' (a term I've never read before) and told him once he agreed to the relationship,  he had no more say - he would always have to be willing to have sex and it would often hurt... "I will force ya if need be, so understand that boy." It wasn't a wife that Hank was wanting,  it was more a BDSM sexual slave. Initiating that with an 18 year old you have had a parental relationship with for at least 4 years,  well,  it reeked of dubious consent to me.It's very short (and I just saw that it has a sequel, though how a snippet of 6,500 words merits a sequel - wouldn't it make more sense to have put them both together?) not especially well written and I won't be looking for more by Keegan Kennedy. </p>

 <p> more sex slave than wife </p>

 <p> A very good erotic read for those who enjoy books of this type.  While the plot was somewhatpredictable it was a decent erotic fiction book. </p>

 <p> sexy read. I do enjoy a built in love relationship.  The characters care for one another already. It's incestuous without being incestuous </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Naughty </p>

 <p> The description was nice, and the story itself could have been brilliant, but the writing wasn't so great. The darker themes were what had me attracted... the execution could have been much better. </p>

 <p> Could have been much better </p>

 <p> I wasn't expecting much from the preview but this is good for a daddy bear/twink kind of story. There were a lot of ways this story could have gone wrong as far as the age difference between Hank and Austin, but it didn't creep me out at all. There was one thing that made me cringe, but I got past it. (I'm not going to spoil it but it has to do with dirty underwear). </p>

 <p> Better than I though it would be. </p>

 <p> Ok book.  Not really what I was expecting, but a fast read...Not much of a story.  Probably won't continue with this author. </p>

 <p> The narrator is a pure submissive bottom boy telling us how he serves his step father till he is eighteen, old enough for the step father not to feel guilty about possessing the kid for his own. Not much of a plot but it works if you like the type of sexual submissiveness between a so much older alpha man and a kid who is really a child if not for his legal age. Sure the stepfather asks for the kid's consent but  does such a sheltered kid who depends on his step father really have a choice. Right, the writer tells us the kid desires to be overpowered and even in love with the stepfather but it is really a convenient excuse to avoid a nonconsensual tone in the story. In the end I just feel uncomfortable. </p>

 <p> Uncomfortable feeling with this one. </p>
