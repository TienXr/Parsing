<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Gamble in Gold </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Seven years ago, Lexie had been the shy, nave exchange student from New Zealand. She had spent six months with the Marchetti family and fell in love with the son. Only that, after he kissed her on that ferris wheel ride, he walked away and never looked back.Seven years later, Luke found her on his flat in nothing but a negligee. All he wanted to do was for her to stay in his house, and finally make his move. Contrary to her belief, he so wanted her. But seven years ago - she was a guest in their house, an exchange student under his family's protection and he had been warned hundreds of times, with threats to stay away from her. They are grownups now, she was her in his house, all he can think about is having a little flirt... and probably a little fling.Lexie, however, knows what she wants and she's not going to settle for anything less. He might have been a very good kisser and can sweep her off her feet. But after what she has been through for a couple of months - she knew she deserves better than a roll in the hay.This one was a short - when I say short, it's really short - SWEET read. It's something you can insert between reads that can make you swoon even in its little pages. I like the characters, especially Lexie on how she outgrown her shyness and being nave, I like that she won't settle for anything less and was brave enough to tell him what she wants. Gamble in Gold was my breather in some heavy novels I have been reading and I have enjoyed every single pages of it!*ARC Copy was given in exchange for an honest review. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A summer time short! </p>

 <p> Gamble In Gold is a nice Summer time read. I felt that this romance should have been longer with more detail and background for the characters. It is a good story line that just needs more of the story. When they were teeenagers, Lexi was an exchange student living with the Marchetti family and was off limits to Luke Marchetti. Fast forward to today and everyone's all grown up. Lexi is still bestfriends with Dani, Luke's sister and Luke is still Lexi's fantasy man. Read this fun contemporary romance to find out if Luke and Lexi rekindle those long ago teenage feelings </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> It was a good fast read. It had wit and charm and you really liked Lexie, even though she was a bit down on her luck at the time. When you first meet her, she's staying at her best friend's brother's apartment looking after his pint-sized dog after his sister calls her and asks if she could look after him, since he went on a hunger strike at the kennel he was staying at. She could even stay at the apartment for the time being too, and then she could start the process of looking for work and a permanent place to stay once her financial situation becomes more stable. Luke, for his part is supposed to be playing some match, somewhere so she's a bit surprised when he shows up in his apartment unexpectedly and sees her in a very sexy negligee . To say he was surprised would have been an understatement. He hadn't seen her in seven years and even though he was the one who got away and broke her heart, little did she know that she was the one for him and she was totally off limits at the time. Anyway, they had great chemistry once they got back together. Lots of comedic moments worthy of an Emmy and even his dog got to steal the show for a bit.  Definitely an Olympic worthy read. You'll definitely enjoy it. </p>

 <p> This one was a little too short for me.  The story went flying by so fast I couldn't get to know the characters.  There wasn't time to introduce any side stories or people (except the dog - who I think is awesom).  A story about a tough guy putting on a show to hide his true feelings from the shy sensitive girl he's loved for years.  Their love was forbidden as children, and now she doesn't trust him.  I think if the story had been fleshed out a little more I could have connected better, but there wasn't enough time to develop the the way I liked.The story was good though, but I always have a soft spot for London.  There are a few very humorous scenes were we get to see a glimpse of the people under their masks.*This book was received in exchange for an honest review* - See more at: [...] </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I've read one other novella by Natalie Anderson, and it really worked for me (Melt).  Gamble in Gold, sadly, did not.  Even though it featured one of my favorite tropes,  it was too short and too predictable to keep me engaged in the story.  Worse yet, a day after reading it, most of the plot has escaped my memory, so it's also fairly forgettable.  Mango the dog, though he played only a small role, was the most memorable character for me.Lexie is crashing at Luke Marchetti's flat while he's out of town.  He's supposed to be gone for a month, so color Lexie very surprised, and also embarrassed, when he walks into his home and finds her in the kitchen.  In a gold negligee.  At the sight of him, Lexie is overcome with many emotions.  She's had a monster crush on him since she was a foreign exchange student staying with his family in high school, and to her dismay, she hasn't gotten over it.  Mix in the hurt from his cool dismissal of her - after sharing her first kiss - and she's instantly on edge and angry.  He's probably still a man whore, lacking any ability to have a real, caring relationship.  When she discovers that he's hurt his leg in a training accident, though, her heart thaws, just a little.  Maybe he's not so bad?Unknown to Lexie, Luke has been attracted to her since she was a shy guest in his parents' home.  When they're caught kissing, his father tells him in no uncertain terms to keep his hands to himself.  With Lexie off limits, Luke turns to serial dating to forget her.  All he does is frustrate himself and break her heart.  With so many misunderstandings between them, can he convince her to give him a second chance?I think my favorite part of Gamble in Gold was Luke's realization that Lexie is the one for him, and that he's finally ready to settle down with one woman.  When she coolly brushes off their night together as nothing more than a one night stand, it's his turn to be hurt.  Lexie is beating herself up for succumbing to Luke's charm, knowing that it will only result in heartache, so she wants to cut to the chase and make him think that he means nothing to her before he can do it to her.  Luke must plead his case, and he has to face some of his fears about a lasting relationship as he does so.I was also disappointed with the length of GiG.  Based on the file size, I thought it would be longer, but the included preview took up a big chunk of the end.Grade: C/C- </p>

 <p> So, today was another novella day. Todays novella is Gamble in Gold by Natalie Anderson. This quick read is pretty cute. Let's get started.Lexie Peterson is down on her luck and decides to make a change in life and scenery. What better place to go to, but London. After all her good friend is there and it's a perfect place to make a fresh start. Anyway, she believes her friend's brother isn't in town so she crashes at his place. Change of plans and Luke Marchetti ends up home.Luke pretty much throws Lexie off her game and she doesn't know what to do. While Luke is trying to figure out how to get into her pants and not hurt her. However, Lexie is a bit leery of Luke, because he kind of had a man whore thing going on when they were younger. The more time he spends with Lexie, Luke isn't sure what he wants anymore.I must say the story is a cute read. The story mainly starts out these two characters rekindling a friendship. However, over a course of a day their relationship changes quickly and Lexie believes Luke is only after one thing. She would have been right the day before, sometimes the heart has other plans. So, if you are looking for a quick read with friends that could be more, you can give Gamble in Gold a try.Copy provided by Publisher </p>

 <p> Gamble in Gold was a great, fast read. I loved Luke and Lexi's story. Especially since Luke knew he wanted more than just a fling with Lexi. Great chemistry between them...smokin' hot! My only complaint is that I felt like just when it was getting good, it ended. I wanted more! Keeping my fingers crossed that the author may revisit them some day. </p>

 <p> If you have an hour or so going begging, then this is the book to fill it with. With 2 amazing characters in Luke and Lexie, along with a great storyline, the sexual tension, build-up, passion, frustration, touching tender moments and hot stuff flow perfectly.It's short, satisfying and sexy. With a gorgeous man that will make your heart flutter (and other places tingle) and a lady that is easy to relate to with her shy nature yet quiet temerity, there is absolutely nothing not to love. It didn't need to be a full length novel, their history didn't need to be any more detailed, but a little epilogue would have been nice (I admit I'm a complete sucker for an epilogue on standalone reads).A book I definitely recommend. </p>

 <p> I have never read anything by Natalie Andersen before, so starting the book I did not have any preconceived notions about how it would be. I loved it! It was a quick read that I did not want to put down. You can feel the tension between Lexie and Luke from the start. The explosion is not unexpected, but some of the emotions are. Definitely a book I could read again and one that makes me want to explore others by this author. </p>
