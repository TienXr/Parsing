<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great Guidebook </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is a very cool travel book about LA.  I learned a lot about the city and what I would need to do to be able to have a great trip there.  It was nicely laid out and the author did definitely do her research before she put out this book, which is good. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Welcome to LA! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Los Angeles is a huge city, and one may be intimidated on how they should plan a vacation if they're looking for a short one. Thankfully, this book breaks it down quite easily, giving all of the hotels and places they can see in just three days. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> a simple guide to Hollywood land. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This little off brand and slightly offbeat travel guide is a no frills and no gimmicks three day itinerary designed more than likely for the first-time tourist it lists the best time to see the most popular attractions. It suggests some of the best restaurants and hotels, and the pages are sprinkled with historical knowledge and interesting informational tidbits designed to make the trip as enjoyable as possible. This is not the most perfect travel guide by any means, but for its price point. It will definitely do the trick. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Next to New York City, I think LA could easily be called one of the greatest super-sized cities in America.  The fast-paced hustle and bustle could easily be compared if not for the difference in the people. The LA culture emanates in everything you see and hear. From the sunny beaches to the incredible sites, LA has it all and this book tells you how to see the best that LA has to offer. The book takes you on a budget friendly tour of this amazing city, giving tips on where to go without breaking the bank. If you&#8217;re traveling soon or just a travel enthusiast, check out this little guide to big fun. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Could have had a better layout </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This has a lot of information about Los Angeles but I think the layout harms it because things aren&#8217;t split up into sections. It is very short so you won&#8217;t have to look too far for things you want, but it would have been helpful if it would have been split into clear, defined sections. What information there is is alright, but Los Angeles is one of the more famous destinations in the Miss Passport series so there&#8217;s probably a lot about it that&#8217;s known already and I think there should have been some more in depth information. </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> This series is worthless. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I have downloaded several of these very short books when they were a Kindle freeby and they have all been useless. I even bought one before I realized what they were because that city had Part 1 and Part 2. Don't waste your money. Check Wikipedia and you will find most, if not all, the information that is in this pamphlet. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A city with charm </p>
