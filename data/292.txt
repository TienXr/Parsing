 <p> I am amazed that such a simpleton like Naruto, can have such debt and insight to his emotions.  That always puts a hell of a twist to his character.  I love it! </p>

 <p> This is my second Shippuden movie that I am frankly disappointed in. The fight scenes are weak, the plot is the weakest yet. Far weaker than even bonds. As a fan of Naurto I'm surprised at the people here saying "The best ever." Three fight scenes, total, that are longer than 20 seconds; And the plot? Really?Pro: Kakashi back story.Con: Everything else.This review will contain minor spoilers, please do not continue if this bothers you.The plot revolves around the abduction of ninja's from the various hidden villages, resulting in the threat of a 4th great war. The leaf village is implicated because the person who appears to have done this was once affiliated with them. Though he is never mentioned anywhere, his back story is that he was part of the same group as pervy sage etc. In fact, he was "Friends" with tsunade etc.Ignoring that weak plot point let's move to weak plot point 2. War is about to break out because this one ninja has proclaimed he wants to kill everyone, including the leaf village, but this apparently makes all other hidden villages think the leaf village is the bad guy for no apparent reason. All other villages prepare to attack the leaf, I mean only the sand village is ever shown but supposedly it's "all". Kakashi is taken. Everyone follows to save him. The bad guy absorbs chakra and all abilities used against him, meaning he can't be beat. Naruto beats him using an ability he just, for again no known reason, didn't use prior to this. For, again no known reason, the bad guy that can absorb ALL chakra, can't absorb this attack made of chakra. Literally as the ability is about to hit him, he simply states, "I can't absorb it...why?" Not nine tails chakra either, just regular Naruto blue. There is then a joke involving that Naruto and Kakashi may be a couple. The end of the movie. </p>

 <p> To commemorate the 10th Anniversary of "Naruto" back in 2009, the third "Naruto: Shippuden" film titled "Gekijoban Naruto Shippuden Hi no Ishi wo Tsugumono" a.k.a. "Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire") was released in theaters (the sixth "Naruto" film overall).As the "Naruto" manga series has begun the "Fourth Great Ninja War" arc and the anime series now gaining momentum in regards to the Akatsuki arc, "Naruto Shippuden the Movie: The Will of Fire" has been released in the U.S. courtesy of Viz Media on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Viz Media.VIDEO & AUDIO:Before I begin, it's important to remind people that a Blu-ray release is available for "Naruto Shippuden The Movie: The Will of Fire"and if you want the best picture and audio quality, the Blu-ray is the way to go.As for the DVD, the film tends to have this look that is appropriate for television, but for a summer movie in Japan, you expect better, detailed artistic backgrounds and the good news is that is what you get with this film.  Presented with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1, the film looks very good.  A lot of detail in the trees, the ground and surrounding environments but also the amount of shading and detail on the characters.  As "Naruto" films become more recent, there is an obvious increase in detail in overall look of the films and "The Will of Fire" looks very good!As for the audio, the audio for "Naruto Shippuden The Movie: The Will of Fire" is featured in Dolby Digital English and Japanese. Similar to a series like "Dragon Ball Z", with "Naruto", I have always enjoyed the voice acting of the English dub series. It's well done and the voices fit the characters very well.  Especially Maile Flanagan's Naruto Uzumaki. Personally, I didn't think there would be a voice actor that could capture Junko Takeuchi's Naruto vocals and sure enough, Flanagan does a great job. But I have watched the series in Japanese and English and for the most part, voice acting for both soundtracks are well-done.Subtitles are in English.SPECIAL FEATURES:"Naruto Shippuden The Movie: The Will of Fire" comes with the Japanese theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to "Naruto" related films, for the most part, a lot of the films are not canon and really have no affect on the main storyline of the manga or anime series.But what I enjoyed about "Naruto Shippuden The Movie: The Will of Fire" is that it brings up three important plot lines that Naruto fans who are watching the anime series have just seen.  Important plot lines that do play a big part in the future of "Naruto Shippuden".Those three plot lines revolves around Naruto's ongoing promise to Sakura that he would bring Sasuke back.  The second revolves around Shikamaru's promise to Asuma about protecting the children of the village and the third which revolves around Kakashi's past of how he obtained the Sharingan and from who.The first two are ongoing promises that are mean to be kept, while the third plays a much bigger part in the "Naruto Shippuden" series which is now being featured in Japan (note: America is a few years behind in storyline via anime series, and a few manga volumes behind from Japan).But "The Will of Fire" is important to show the bond between the Konoha ninjas and as always with Naruto, he is never the type of person that would let anyone be hurt.  He is a protector and his goal to be Hokage means protecting everyone from harm's way.And when both his goal and Shikamaru's goal clashes, it's quite interesting to see how their fellow teammates respond when they must stop Naruto, as some believe in what Naruto is doing and others knowing they have a mission to do and the mission is priority.There is also another cool addition to this film and that is another fight between Naruto and Gaara which I was not expecting.  It's one thing for Naruto, Sakura and Sai to go after Kakashi and get into a duel with Hiruko's protectors and also his own fellow ninja from Konoha, but to see Gaara involved and possibly meant to stop Naruto as well, that was cool to see another skirmish between the two, despite their admiration towards each other.Suffice to say, this is an action-packed film and definitely one of the better summer "Naruto" films created because it has a stronger connection to the series when it comes to the characters and what they are fighting for.  While the previous film "Bonds" was great to see Naruto and Sasuke fight against each other and briefly work together, "The Will of Fire" is much more exciting due to the amount of characters and battles involved.As for the DVD, picture quality and audio are good but if one wants better PQ and AQ, the Blu-ray is the way to go.  While I'm not sure if the Blu-ray release has more special features, I was surprised that the DVD only has the Japanese theatrical trailer.Overall, "Naruto" fans will surely enjoy this movie.  Naruto vs. Gaara, Naruto vs. his teammates in the hopes of saving Kakashi.  Exciting, action-packed and definitely the best "Naruto" film yet!"Naruto Shippuden The Movie: The Will of Fire" is recommended! </p>

 <p> I usually like Naruto movies in general, but this one seemed kind of lacking. It is a decent enough movie and perfect for a rainy weekend when everyone is out of the house and nothing else is on t.v. There isn't anything I can point out in particular, it's just when all is said and done, this isn't one of the more memorable movies. I had to stop and think about what happened in this movie before I could review it. </p>

 <p> When it comes to naruto movies im not a huge fan as i obviously prefer the anime.All of the 5 previous naruto movies felt more like long bursts of filler that simply arent interesting to anyone who doesnt like filler or only cares about the overall storyline. However the will of fire is the exception. This is an amazing film and the best anime-based movie i have seen next to the Full metal alchemist movie.Story: The premise of the film is this: 4 ninja are targeting the 5 kekkei genkai(Basically the special ability of the 5 hidden villages major clans). The reason is for the leader of the group to obtain the perfect and immortal power they hold. Kakashi is targeted because of his sharingan. In response he and the hokage make a plan to stop the villian but it will come at a great price. Kakashi leaves the village and as you can guess naruto and sakura go after kakashi to get him to return home. Now that i explained the first 20 or so minutes of the film lets move on to the other parts of the filmMusic:The music is flawless. It can be the sad and emotional music that most anime are known for.It can also be the energetic Blood pumping music that goes with each fight.Action/fights: Since this is a naruto movie there has to be quite a bit of action. This movie has amazingly good fight scenes. They feel like as if you took a fight from the anime and sped it up and shortened it to about 5 minutes. The best fights are the final fight and Garra vs naruto towards the end. I wont spoil either.Overall Naruto shippuden: The will of fire is an amazing film and i suggest you rent it off of amazon instant video or purchase the DVD or bluray at no less than 20 because anywhere above 20 dollars is too much.Story: 9.9/10 I took off .1 because i felt the story was a little predictable because obviously no main character from the series can die in anything outside of the anime or manga.Music: 10/10 as i said amazing.action:10/10 as i said amazing also.Final score 29.9/30 (anything above 27/30 is worth 5 stars in my scoring system) </p>

 <p> One of the great Naruto movies. This one is one of my favorites.When Kakashi suddenly leaves the village Naruto and his friends set on after him not listening to the Hokage's orders to stay away. So the chase begins, Naruto is chasing after his sensei while his friends are chasing after him trying to stop him. Full of intense battles and secrets. This is the best Naruto film so far! </p>

 <p> Pretty much your typical Naruto anime movie- like one big filler episode.I did enjoy this release because I'm a big fan of the English voice acting, and it sure didn't disappoint. The only thing I noticed different was that Gaara's dub voice actor was different.. maybe I was just hearing things but I am 99.9% sure he got a new voice actor, if anyone can prove this then please feel free to, as I'm going off of my memory with this one.The Blu-ray discs quality is great, the colors look amazing in 1080p and fit perfectly on a nice flat screen HD TV. No complaints with the quality, another good HD remaster by Viz Media as far as I'm concerned.The packaging for the Blu-ray release was your typical cheap and flimsy recyclable Blu-ray disc holding case sadly. There was a single paper insert for Neon Alley but that is about it. The only extras contained on this release are trailers for Neon Alley (shocking, eh?), the small dub trailer for this movie and I believe the original Japanese trailer as well, I could be wrong about that one though.Overall this is just another Naruto movie and I would only suggest die-hard fans of the series pick it up and view it, or else you'll get very bored very fast(in my opinion, that is.) which is why I won't be giving it anything less than 5 stars, because what can you really expect from a shounen series movie at this point? </p>

 <p> If you've seen some of the Naruto movies then the basic story of this one shouldn't surprise you as while you'll get a new enemy the story is pretty much the same seen with the last Naruto movie and the last one before that.It's good to see that the price is reasonable for the movie though so it's forgivable enough to warrant getting the dvd for your anime collection just keep any real expectation to a minimum as there really isn't more to the movie other then the Naruto characters and some decent fight scenes but pretty much nothing else. </p>

 <p> Being a fan of Naruto I am leaning towards excellence always. This was very good and showed something as usual you have not seen at the end of the battle. Only drawback with any Naruto stuff is it cannot match up to his learning to be a sage and the battle with Lord Pain. </p>
