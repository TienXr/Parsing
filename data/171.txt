 <p> Loved it as a kid, and had to own it as an adult. Marooned is one of those movies that defined an age and defined us as youngsters. Flawed? Who cares. It's not Shakespeare, nor is it meant to be. It's a sci fi classic set in modern times. The effects were striking then and they still are. If you don't think so,you're just jaded. Seeing the Apollo spacecraft captured in space, courtesy of the Oscar winning effects, still gives me a chill. It was even more thrilling to see the Vostok spacecraft up there on the screen in living color and, since I was a NASA buff, I felt like I was the only one in the theatre who recognized the experimental DynaSoar spacecraft piloted by David Jannssen.The movie is a total blast, and Gregory Peck gives another of his classic performances. I still get chills watching his stoic character get emotional, cheering "GO...GO...GO", as the rescue vehicle is launched through the eye of the hurricane.Terrific fun and I'm thrilled to have it in my collection. </p>

 <p> Three astronauts, already debilitated after five months in the Saturn Orbital Laboratory space station, are stranded in their return vehicle, when the engines fail to fire up. The film consists of the efforts to rescue them, the air that is measured out by the minute, the tensions that arise between the astronauts in the small capsule, and their wives, who bravely try to cope. The plot could get predictable were it not for the taut, plausible script, the well-paced direction by John Sturges, the marvelous acting, and the sound. This is the only film I can remember seeing that has no musical soundtrack, just gripping sound effects that add so much to the tension. Even after repeated viewings, this film has an edginess, and it owes much of it to its imaginative use of sound.Gregory Peck puts in another stellar performance as Chief of Manned Space Charles Keith, who is strong, decisive, and thoughtful; the conversation he has with the stranded crew about oxygen is memorable, and as the commander, Richard Crenna is terrific, and Gene Hackman, an astronaut with a high strung temperament, and James Franciscus are also excellent, as are their wives, Lee Grant, Mariette Hartley and Nancy Kovak, and David Janssen, as a fourth astronaut.Four months and 2 days after this film was released, Apollo 13 was plagued with its problems, and went through a similar scenario; for those who believe in the powers of the mind, some could argue it was predictive, and others say life imitated art...at any rate, the coincidence is interesting, and one imagines that either the Apollo 13 crew or their families might have seen this film before their mission, and pondered the possibilities.This film is classified as &quot;sci-fi&quot;, though in spirit it is perhaps closer to the disaster films that would become so popular in the '70s. Panned by many critics, it is still alive and breathing well after all these years and the special effects, which won the film an Oscar, retain their freshness and are excellent. It received nominations for Best Cinematography (Daniel Fapp) and Best Sound.Total running time is 134 minutes. </p>

 <p> Fairly good special effects, budget and an impressive cast bring Martin Caidin's classic novel to life. The almost documentary feel of 'Marooned' may have been intentional and space films often looked to the fantastic far-future rather than the realistic near-future 'Marooned' portrayed. This film is rather slow and deliberate at times, but that isn't a surprise considering that movies like '2001' were also made in this era. So 'Marooned' is to be valued as a realistic rarity in any decade. There were and ARE too few real space program films being made. If only Martin Caidin had written more things like 'Marooned'. </p>

 <p> Aside form Ice Station Zebra, director John Stuges brings Martin Caidin's classic novel of a joined resucue mission by NASA and the Russina Space program with excellent precision and accuracy. Most of all, the late director stays true to Caidin's work. Not only does the movie have award-winning special effects, a good, solid plot, excellent actors and actresses, it also stays true to what NASA would do in a situation like this.The film centers around the crew of the Apollo spacecraft IRONMAN 1, and how they are starnded in Earth orbit. While NASA and the Russians prepare a joint rescue operation, the astronauts learn that one or two of them must sacrifice themselves because of their limited oxygen supply. From that point on, it is a race against time to rescue the astronauts from a slow death.Another cool thing about this movie was the actually filming in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the stock footage of the Apollo 11 mission taking off from the launch pad. It really captures the era it was set in. Marooned is an excellent film. More science fact than science fiction. If you are a follower of the space program, then you might want to consider checking this film out.  It's worth watching. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> While watching Marooned (1969), one can't help but make comparisons to Ron Howard's much more successful and popular Apollo 13 (1995), but, as the latter was based on real life events, Marooned supposes a very likely scenario, one that asks what would happen if astronauts were stranded in space, unable to return to Earth.  Oddly enough, similar events did occur in 1970, a year after Maroon's release, events that eventually became incorporated into the film Apollo 13...sweet irony...written by Martin Caidin, who also created the Bionic Man, and directed by John Sturges, who did films like Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), The Magnificent Seven (1960), The Great Escape (1963), and Ice Station Zebra (1968), Marooned enlists a highly capable and talented group of actors including Gregory Peck, Richard Crenna, David Janssen, James Franciscus, Gene Hackman (with hair even), and Lee Grant.The film starts off with a seemingly routine launch of Ironman One and three astronauts, Jim Pruett (Crenna), Clayton Stone, or Stoney (Franciscus), and Buzz Lloyd (Hackman) into space.  Their mission is to dock with an orbiting station, remain there for about seven months, and then return.  The basic goal is to evaluate the effect of keeping men in space for long periods of time, with an eye towards manned space missions to other planets within our system.  After about five months (in movie time, of course), the men begin to show fatigue, getting a bit careless with some of the non-vital equipment, and the decision is made to have them return a bit early.  They return to the capsule, begin their preparations to return to Earth.  Everything seems to be going alright, that is, until the computer fails to fire rockets meant to push them into their descent.  Nothing appears to be malfunctioning, but the rocket won't fire.  Well now this is a pickle...returning to the space station isn't an option as it's too far away.  What to do?  Charles Keith (Peck), head of manned space missions at NASA, comes to the conclusion that the situation is what it is...the men, having limited oxygen (we learn that the capsule will probably return to Earth under the natural pull of gravity in about five to seven years), that they are pretty much doomed, as there isn't time sufficient to launch a rescue operation.  You see, all these scenarios have been developed, and the men who go into space are `professionals' as Keith put it, and full on knew the inherit risks in their particular occupation.  Ted Dougherty (Janssen), second in command behind Keith, is a bit more emotional about the situation, pushing for a rescue operation, despite all the data supporting the fact that it can't be done.  So the fate of these three men is sealed?  It would seem so, until Keith gets a call from The President...that's right, the big cheese, the head honcho, the main man...who tells Keith that it's all of their best interests to attempt a rescue operation.  Not doing so would not only be the equivalent of political suicide for the president, but also it would effectively curtail, maybe even end, any future manned space missions.  Given his orders, Keith gives the order to go ahead with the manned rescue mission, piloted by Doughtery.  Will he succeed?  Unlikely, as the amount of time involved in prepping a manned launch into space is extraordinary, and given the amount of oxygen the three men have left, it seems futile at best.  Oh yeah, on top of everything else, a hurricane is approaching the launch site at the very time the rescue ship is to be launched...when it rains, it pours...The film is a bit dry at times, given to so much technical information related throughout the film, but it really seemed the makers of the film focused on trying to make everything as realistic as possible.  I wouldn't have thought a manned space mission could be put together so quickly, but it was made to seem almost possible here.  Crenna, Franciscus, and Hackman are great as the three marooned astronauts, each reacting in their own particular ways to not only the claustrophobia of the tiny capsule, but also the knowledge that they are basically dead men floating, and their time extremely limited.  I did feel Hackman's character, especially when he started losing it, seemed a bit out of character, as I would have thought dispositions to that kind of thing would have been screened out in the selection program, but who knows?  Even the hardest egg can crack, given the right amount of pressures.  Peck was great as the calm, cool, logical, seemingly detached from humanity man in charge, making the difficult decisions, keeping everything on track.  He played the role of the pragmatic perfectly, appearing to be the `bad guy' at times, but ultimately coming through as the perfect man to be in charge, especially at a time like this.  This comes through the most when Keith informs the three man crew of a particularly difficult decision that they have to make, one you wouldn't wish on anyone. Janssen was also very good, but again, another character that seemed out of character, especially when he went off on Peck's character in their dispute over mounting a rescue operation.  Flying off the handle doesn't seem like a characteristic I would want in someone in such a position, especially given the nature of the circumstances, but hey, I'm only along for the ride...Anyway, is this movie any good?  I thought so, despite it's over two hour run time (I think it ended up being like 130 minutes).  I did feel a slight lack of chemistry between some of the characters, especially the astronauts, compared to those in the film Apollo 13, and there was less character development, too, but I still enjoyed the film.  The wide screen print is really sharp, along with the audio.  No special features except a few trailers for other science fiction films.Cookieman108 </p>

 <p> A suspenseful tale of three astronauts trapped in a malfunctioning ship orbiting the earth.  After many months in space one of the astronauts shows signs of fatigue and they opt to bring them down.  Unfortunately the boosters won't function and they are stranded.  The star packed cast manages to keep you interested and on edge with the slow moving storyline.  But for the time period (1969) the special effects were good enough to take home an Oscar. </p>

The astronauts were like logs; not even on takeoff did they move.It finally got somewhat suspenseful toward the end.  I love Greg Peck, but this wasn't the greatest role for him. Overall, if youlike the actors, it would be worth watching at a reduced price. </p>

 <p> "Marooned" (1969), starring some heavy-hitting talent (including Gregory Peck, Gene Hackman, David Janseen, and James Fransicuss) shows how a slow, measured, methodical pace with each frame filled with intelligence can succeed brilliantly where so many of today's short-attention-span-geared films fail miserably.  The nicely-serviceable special effects, the attention to detail that rivals/surpasses that of "2001: a space odyssey" (the hardware is firmly-grounded on then-present day technology), the slow, plodding nail-biter pace, and the fine acting all make for a great film.  While there are those who think that the slow pace makes this a boring film, I submit that these critics are more often than not of the "raw-meat/15-minute-maximum attention span/Rambo" school of film fandom.  However, if you are aching for an intellectual gem of a film that acknowledges that you've actually got a brain -- case in point: this film portrays the Russian space effort (which was, back in '69, the only other manned space game in our global village) in a respectful light -- then "Marooned" is just what the doctor ordered.  Blast off! </p>

 <p> Though not an unflawed work like Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was, the 1969 sci-fi drama MAROONED manages to overcome its obvious flaws.  The film concerns itself with the crew of Ironman One who, after having spent seven months in a converted Apollo capsule (a precursor to Skylab and the international space station) to test Man's endurance in space, find themselves trapped in their capsule some 300 miles above Earth when the craft's retro-rockets refuse to fire.  This forces NASA to try and mount a last-ditch rescue effort before the oxygen inside Ironman gives out and the crew suffocate.  Complications involve having to launch the rescue craft through the eye of a hurricane passing over the Florida launch site, but the rescue pilot (David Janssen) gets some unexpected help from a Russian cosmonaut orbiting in a nearby Voshkod spacecraft.MAROONED is, as I've said, not an unflawed film.  The dialogue that the fine cast, which includes Gregory Peck, Richard Crenna, and Gene Hackman, has to deal with is arguably quite banal.  Another complication that arises is that the film's director, John Sturges, was better known for his work in the western genre (including THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN) and was thus not totally comfortable in the sci-fi genre.  The third problem is that the special effects, which won a justly deserved Oscar in 1969, are obviously dated in ways in which those of "2001" aren't.As a pre-cursor of things to come, however, MAROONED is unbelievably prescient.  The film was released in December 1969.  Four months later, in April 1970, the film's situation was echoed almost directly by the real-life saga of Apollo 13, whose three-man crew was almost stranded permanently in space when one of their oxygen tanks exploded on their way to the Moon.  And like the 1995 film APOLLO 13, MAROONED shows NASA trying to come up with the right solutions to a very difficult situation.  On that score alone, even though thirty years of cinematic advancements have rendered it dated to a certain degree, MAROONED still has considerable weight to it. </p>

 <p> "Marooned" while taking place in outer space is not some kind of science fiction film with aliens or meteors threating to hit the Earth. Rather it is a serious piece of drama of three American astronauts whose lives are in danger when their capsule fails to fire its retro rockets to bring the crew home. The story looks at both the astronauts themselves dealing with the struggle to survive in the capsule while back down on Earth NASA officials are struggling with how to bring the team of Ironman One back home. This becomes a tense storyline as events are happening with a realism to it that would actually foreshadow the events that would take place a little over 4 months after "Marooned" debut in theaters with the aborted Apollo 13 mission.The writing is taunt. The special effects are brilliant and would in fact go on to win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects of 1969. The sound effects are also brilliant helping to bring a feeling of desperation and doom to the atmosphere of the film. The acting is outstanding but when you have a cast that includes Gregory Peck, Gene Hackman, James Franciscus, Richard Crenna, David Janssen, Nancy Novak, Lee Grant and Mariette Hartley you would not expect otherwise.If you like outer space science fiction kind of movies then "Marooned" is not for you since this is an out and out drama. If on the other hand you are not a fan of science fiction don't let the plot of this movie stop you from seeing this. "Marooned" is a very suspenseful, nail biting drama that will leave you on the edge of your seat while it is playing and applauding when the film is over. This is a great movie to watch and add to your video collection. </p>

 <p> This may indeed be though of as a "space movie" because much of it takes place in space but to do so is to miss the point. It is a human drama.An Apollo capsule has been in space for a while and the crew are tired and worn out. They are finally returning to earth but something goes wrong. Houston, we have a problem. At first, it is treated as just a temporary glitch but the glitch defies resolution. It becomes apparent that the astronauts run a real risk of running out of air.Gregory Peck plays the NASA director. He is a tough man motivated by the best interests of the program. He does not see a real way to rescue the marooned astronauts. It is pointed out to him, however, that failure to even try will spell the doom of the program. Once he gets on board, he does so with every resource he can muster. Unfortunately, there is a hurricane heading for the cape. That makes launching a rescue even more problematical.Meanwhile, on the stranded ship, the astronauts have their own problems. They realize they are on borrowed time and there is not a thing that they can do to help themselves. Saying goodbye to their families exhausts their capabilities.It is a sad tale extremely well done. It does not focus on the machinery, instead it focuses on the people. </p>

 <p> This thriller came out months before Apollo 13 was launched and while it could be said it is an omen, really this is a white knuckle thriller.Three astronauts are trapped in space after their retro's won't fire to let them come home. The rest is a race to try to save the men even though most think it is a lost cause. Simple as that,but the thrills all stem from that and if you let it will pull you in and make you sweat.The cast is great and the F/X are great,so sit back and see how to make a thriller that doesn't relie on guns and explosions to keep you engrossed! </p>

 <p> Marooned(1969) is a sci-fi film based on Martin Caidin's 1964 novel. Marooned(a.k.a. Space Travellers) is very, very, very slow paced. It's like watching molasses slither down a tree! Marooned is the only Academy Award-winning film to be shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000. There's no music score for Marooned. It's driven by sound effects. For a "science fiction film", it sure has a strong sense of realism. Three astronauts played by Richard Crenna, Gene Hackman, and James Franciscus are trapped on a space vessel, Ironman One. The U.S. Government races against time to rescue them before their oxygen runs out. The Film Ventures International version of Marooned swaps a beautiful shot of the Earth with a shot of a video camera pressed against a globe! The MST3K version deletes scenes such as David Janssen's ship being delivered to a launching pad or Gene Hackman yelling, "Don't kill me!" Director John Sturges(The Magnificent Seven, The Great Escape) does a sincere job directing the film. Marooned was blessed with an $8 million budget and state-of-the-art visual effects. Gregory Peck is quite good in this film. Mariette Hartley and Nancy Kovacs co-star. Marooned is worth watching if you're very, very, very patient. </p>

 <p> Three astronauts find themselves trapped high above the earth when the space capsule Iron-man One becomes disabled. The NASA ground team races to bring them back alive while each crew member wrestles with his impending asphyxiation in the tiny spacecraft. A rescue mission brings hope to the crew, but it may not arrive in time to save all three men. Marooned is not an action-adventure movie, but rather a skillful character study. Most modern viewers of Marooned are likely to become bored by its pace, and the movie could have been trimmed by about twenty minutes to keep the plot moving. But, there's a method to this madness and everything about Marooned--from its deliberate pacing to its haunting single-chord soundtrack--is designed to evoke the vastness of space and its unrelenting hostility. Such an auspicious intent demands top-notch dialogue and performances, and Marooned successfully delivers some of the highest quality drama ever shown in a disaster movie. On the ground, we watch the chief of the manned space program Keith (Peck) slowly transform from a by-the-book director to a passionate leader determined to save his men. Peck's performance is understated but complete and peaks during the dicey launch of the rescue ship, which is jeopardized by a hurricane. Keith quietly paces and stews as the audience sweats through the countdown and watches the wind speed on the launch creep toward the redline. Meanwhile, the astronauts aboard Ironman One slowly deteriorate as their time and oxygen both run out. Each astronaut copes with death in different ways. The elder, experienced Commander Pruett (Crenna) quietly resigns himself to his fate. Pilot Lloyd (Hackman) is the opposite, and quickly becomes anxious and paranoid. Scientist Stone (Franciscus) is the most interesting character, as he combines the philosophical qualities of the Commander with the vocal tendencies of the Pilot. Stone becomes a metaphor for the movie itself, as he becomes fascinated with the concept of his own death by suffocation and studies himself in the same way that the movie studies the group. First from a philosophical standpoint and then later, from an almost spiritual perspective, Stone analytically explores the process of dying. He is intellectual and in control of his senses until only a few minutes of oxygen remain. Marooned is even more disturbing because the special effects are so good that the suspension of disbelief is never broken. Marooned won an academy award in 1969 for Special Visual Effects, in part because the movie exercised such tremendous restraint. The effects, like the movie, are paced very slowly and intended to establish the mood of actual movement and activity in a zero-G environment. It's hard to imagine the reception that greeted Marooned when it was first released. The concept that our own technology might fail and precipitate a situation whereby one astronaut's suicide must be considered as a method of saving the remaining crew members is very disturbing. Marooned forces the viewer to confront this morally unthinkable dilemma. Spoiler alert: the scene where all three astronauts are forced to decide which of them will, as Lloyd put it, 'have to go,' is desperately calm and all the more terrifying for it. Marooned is high drama set in space. For those with a longer attention span, Marooned is a very disturbing but incredibly satisfying piece of work. If you haven't become interested in the premise within the first thirty minutes of the movie, just switch it off and save yourself the time. For, just like the unchanging qualities of the movie's hostile environment, Marooned retains a similar tone throughout. </p>

 <p> Marooned was a poor movie at best having a minimal story, weak acting and dialogue, poor special effects, and no musical score to speak of. Rocky Jones Space Ranger, the TV space opera of the 50's for kids, had far better special effects. The drawn out ending was actually painful to sit through and watching the three astronauts go bouncing off the walls was not an interesting or credible story.It is amazing that this film received any awards for special effects as the screen effects in Marooned featured suspended plastic models against simple and often very out of scale backgrounds. The crude models were not even airbrushed and reflected light off their specular points in the very unrealistic lighting. How this effort warranted an academy award when compared to 2001 is criminal.  In Hollywood anything is possible as great work can be totally ignored and mediocre work praised.I first saw this film in 1969 with a close friend at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York. I went to see it in high hopes of a good film experience with fresh memories of 2001 and knowledge of what can be done with good sci-fi film.  This was not to be. I think we both agreed that this film was pretty bad. </p>

 <p> A seven-month tour aboard an orbiting space station is cut short by Mission Control once it becomes evident the crew is fatigued and demoralized--failing to keep up with the schedule, a decreasing concern with hygiene, even losing tools during EVA.  The astronauts readily comply with the evacuation orders . . . but then their return capsule DOES NOT START.  "We have negative retrofire," they report to Mission Control.Thus begins the tense, grueling story of three men counting the hours till they either asphyxiate or are rescued in a last-gasp effort--by an untested, prototype spacecraft.  Earthside, NASA engineers scramble against the odds to bring their three astronauts home.This is one of the most scientifically solid space movies I've ever seen.  The movie opens with a detailed look at the astronauts' launch into orbit aboard Ironman 1, complete with techno chatter between various NASA departments reporting they are "All Systems Go."  Post-launch, we see first and second stage separations, orbital insert, and even the docking of Ironman 1 with the space station.  As I said, all very solid; no gee-whiz George Lucas stuff.Released in 1969, a time when most Americans believed NASA could do no wrong, this movie offers startling honesty about the perils of spaceflight and the inherent limitations of technology.  It is superbly cast with Gregory Peck and David Janssen at Mission Control, and James Franciscus, Gene Hackman and Richard Crenna as the marooned astronauts.  Also many other smaller roles whose actors I'm sure you'll recognize.I unreservedly recommend this movie. </p>

 <p> Marooned is another movie that was ahead of its time.  Gregory Peck is at his very best in this movie.  When the police stop him for speeding and Gregory gets a call on their police radio from the president, the reaction from the police was real.  Prior to the call Gregory tried to tell them who he was but didn't overplay his importance because he was speeding. The police officers showed respect by moving away so he could speak to the president.  In their action they acknowledged that they were wrong.  Apollo 13 producer had to have watched Marooned to see how astronauts react to stressful situations in space.  Great movie! </p>

 <p> If you liked Apollo 13, you should love this space suspense film that came out at the height of the space program.  The special effects are good, the acting great, the story and screenplay  (concerning a rescue attempt of stranded astronauts) suspenseful and dramatic.  It's hard to find many serious science fiction films that will satisfy a space enthusiast - this is one of the few, along with Destination Moon and Mission to Mars. </p>

 <p> The ratings are for the actual movie as the DVD is well, a DVD.  The picture quality is good on this issue and the shipper shipped fast. The movie today, probably seems different than when it was issued and it was the first movie I saw in a Drive In Movie theater in my small town. That theater is now a shopping center, so this movie brings back memories. The ending sort of stinks, as it well, just ends with the banner &#34;The End&#34;. No remarkable or memorable ending like Apollo 13 really. The movie was fairly accurate in terms of NASA and space terminology and the special effects for its time were fantastic. </p>

 <p> The 1969 classic Marooned starring Gene Hackman and Gregory Peck is about three astronaunts, nearly completing a seven month mission in a space station, stranded and it's up Peck and the entire ground control crew to rescue them. There certaintly a chilling element to this film, quietness. When the retro rockets refuse to fire, the problem is presented with somewhat of a wimper than a bang. The ground control notice the problem with some surprise but they thick they can handle it, the tension builds and soon the calm and controled Peck is fighting it out with his own crew. Gregory Peck's unshakable demeanor helps his role as a leader figure he operates on logic but sometimes forgets emotion, it's the perfect casting. Hackman plays the astronaunt who eventually snaps, going into a boiling rage with his unfounded guilt and his desire to go home; It's an intense preformance to say the least. The finale is probably one the greatest and simultaneously eerily quiet in film history. One of tha astronaunts already killed themselves to perserve the dwindling oxygen supply and Hackman and his fellow astronaunt suffer the effects of a low amount of oxygen to the brain; Or should I say they fall into a false sense of security because of the low oxygen. I was almost tempted to cheer with ground crew when the two survivors were rescued because the entire film was just so intense. This film was more affective than Ron Howard's Apollo 13 which far too concerned with special effects and the loud music hightening the attention. This film directed by John Sturges created a far darker atmosphere with those three men being stranded in space, every breath they drew could have been their last and you felt it. An amazing film which still holds up today. </p>

 <p> Marooned is a very well written movie with an all star cast, excellent story line, and a must have for your movie collection.  A Sci-Fi about our space program, and the risks involved with space flight.  It touches on achievements, team effort, and tragic developments.  If you haven't seen it, you're missing a really great film.Thomas </p>

 <p> I seldom award five stars to anything -- to deserve the top rating it must be nearly flawless. Marooned is one of those very few that do.The story is seemingly simple: an Apollo spacecraft with a crew of three experiences a failure that leaves it marooned in orbit with an oxygen supply of 46 hours. All attempts to correct the malfunction fail. A rescue mission is launched.Simple, right?. Anything but! The tension slowly ratchets up throughout the film as NASA and the USAF confront and surmount obstacle after obstacle that block their every effort. First there is Keith's dry "the proposal is refused" response to the rescue mission. It takes the US President telling him to "put away your slide rule" to convince him that the rescue mission must be mounted at all cost. Eventually, we see Keith change from a hardheaded engineer to a true leader of men determined to accomplish the impossible rescue. He and his team cut through the maze of procedural orthodoxy to get the XRV and Titan booster ready in 42 hours, they risk launching the non-man rated rocket and untried spacecraft even without the necessary computer programs ("just put me in the ballpark and I'll fly it in manually"). Finally they are nearly thwarted by an unexpected hurricane, but succeed nonetheless.Paralleling all this is the plight of the stranded astronauts. Together they struggle in their efforts to conserve oxygen (taking sleeping pills, keeping calm, distracting themselves) and agonize over the option of going EVA to inspect the spacecraft.Notice that in this space flick there are no space aliens, no explosions, no shooting, no warp-speed dogfights or desperate jumps into hyperspace, no cantinas for gunslinging aliens. This is, little doubt, the reason for the few one- and two-star reviews here. Sorry fellas, this is a film for adults. If your mental age is less than thirty, or your attention span is less than two minutes, then no, you probably will dislike this film.There are complaints that the pace is too slow, but I say that the plot moves along briskly from event to event. Yes, many or most all of the scenes are "just people talking" but they are talking about important and pertinent things having to do directly with the plot or with the character motivations. I don't see one single scene that could be deleted from the movie without taking away from its effect. Marooned is the most nearly perfect story of its kind ever filmed.The scenes aboard Ironman 1 following the launch of the XRV are the most understated and poignant I have ever seen in film. In particular I refer to their necessary decision to sacrifice one of themselves so the other two astronauts can survive. Just for such a situation to arise is itself a most compelling feature. The writers have included the full range of possible human reactions: dark humor ("Let's do this scientifically -- the two big guys throw the little guy out"), denial, as when Stone comments that there probably really is enough O2 for the three of them until the resuce; rage, catatonia, euphoria (Hatch blown!), and finally, Pruett's courageous decision to get it over with at last (refusing Lloyd's dry offer "well, it's logical it should be me since I'm using the most oxygen"). What especially struck me was the subtle way Pruett decides to go about the grim business. He vows to go out and "fix that engine" when in fact he knows as well as the other two that he isn't going to. In this way, he transforms himself from a hapless victim of a space accident into a hero who set out on an impossible task. The only way I think this could have been improved would have been to stress that he is the mission commander and felt responsible for his two subordinate crew members. Perhaps he was an ex-USN ship captain and this feeling is deeply ingrained in his character. The movie does not make this explicit but that's the way I choose to interpret it.The special effects are not the equal of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but they are nevertheless quite good. There are some scenes in which the colors are whited out. This happens when the camera is shooting downsun and the scene is washed in the solar glare. Also, the microgravity is respresented quite well given the technology in 1969. The actors were suspended from well-placed bungee cords or on spring-mounted platforms. The space scenes were not shot abourd the NASA Vomit Comet as were the scenes in Apollo 13.I detected only a very few technical errors in the movie. For one, NASA would not have used a Saturn V merely to deliver an Apollo CSM to Earth orbit. They would have used the cut-down Saturn IB used to launch the Skylab crews, and the Apollo 9 mission to Earth orbit to flight test the LEM.Lastly, I don't believe that the command module has enough cabin air to push the entire CSM away from the Voshkod as portrayed. At any rate, it would not simply have translated and then come to a stop; it would have continued drifting away because another thrust would have to necessary to arrest the craft's translational motion. Also, since the gas escapted through the CM hatch, it would have caused the CSM to tumble. The hatch is located far from the craft's center of mass.Most importantly, given the depth of mission risk planning taken by NASA, they would not have expended so much of the RCS propellant to preclude returning to the space station after the retroburn failed. NASA would never foreclose such an alternative mission option. (Of course, it was necessary to the story for it to have been impossible for the crew to return to the Skylab.) I believe the filmmakers should have had the retroburn proceed about halfway through and then have it fail (perhaps with a small explosion to satisfy the children in the audience who need such excitement).All in all, a drama not to be missed, and the most significant space film ever made. For adults, that is. </p>
