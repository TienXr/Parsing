 <p> I loved the fan it worked great until i decided to take my xbox apart and solder it the right way. This mod is not for new people. </p>

 <p> Got this fan for my older modeled case. This fan sucks the hot air from the case as the back exhaust. The LEDs are extremely bright and continue to be bright. I have not seen a change in brightness since i bought the thing. Only problem i would say the fan has is that after a while the LEDs melt the holes they are in. However this does not effect the fans performance, i just assumed that was what the manufacturer intended. At the end of the day it is a great product and i am happy to recommend it. It has been 6 months since i bought the fan and it continues to blow/glow strong to this day. </p>

 <p> This is a very quiet fan to run. And the lights out of it are very bright. If you are going for a light theme like I did, then these fans are perfect. </p>

 <p> Pros- Very bright and move a good volume of airCons-  Loud !! but i guess thats the sacrifice for having a push/pull configuration on the CPU </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Powerful but loud </p>

 <p> Plugged 2 as case fans via the PSU and boy,  are they loud! However, they sure push a lot of air and are even more effective than my 120mms. In fact, I'd say one can displace close to my Silverstone AP180 on high.On a side note, one of them shipped without the wires soldered to the board. I had to solder it myself thus the 3 stars. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Good.  Moves a lot of air. </p>

 <p> Just put this in a microATX build for my son, as it had a 92mm rear exhaust mount.It looks good, the blue LEDs are quite a bit brighter than I expected.  Make sure you know what you're getting into.Moves a lot of air (a LOT of air, especially for this size--I feel like the exhaust is pushing out what my 120mm exhausts push out, but I did not scientifically measure), and consequently, there is some noise to it.  Unfortunately, the motherboard in the system only had a non-controllable fan header left available, so I cannot comment how this fan looks/sounds on lower voltage/RPM, as in my configuration it's always on max.  But I'm guessing at 50% power you wouldn't hear a thing.I'd buy it again. </p>

 <p> Just got this fan to add to my new Cooler Master Hyper TX3 for my AMD FX8350.  This fit into my bracket for the second fan like a charm and only took a minute to install.  Moves a significant amount of air, I am sure it is helping with cooling.  Blue LED's look great with the rest of my blue hardware. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Buy this right now! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Item functions as it should and is less noisy than my previous case fan (a delta 92mm). However, if the room is quiet, you can hear it humming away; not very annoying though. Good air flow, and blue LEDs give a nice effect. Recommended. </p>
