 <p> This 17.3 notebook laptop sleeve is perfect for what I use it for. I have two 17.3 laptop computers one is a dell inspironmulti media. the other one is an Hp dv7 pavellon the Hp is not as slim as the Dell but both laptops will fit in the sleeve.I don't use the sleeve to travel with.  I have two portable laptop computer tables. When one of these computers is not in useI keep it in the Kitty to go sleeve to protect it from dust. I have one computer in the living room the other in the bedroom.My Kitty to go sleeve is busy!!!! Shipping was fast packed well.. </p>

 <p> Purchased for my wife's Netbook. It works ok, not so much as a protection from shock (after all it is just a Neoprene sleeve) but she likes it because she can stuff all her wires in it and it's cute. </p>

 <p> This cute case  with the kitty front and back view has rings on the side for a strap.  It is used for the Toshiba nb255 netbook.  The netbook's battery sticks out so i had to really stretch the zipper to fit it in.  I'm glad for the neoprene that stretches.  Hopefully the zipper will last.  It is perfect for other netbooks that do not have this bulging battery like the Toshiba has but it will do fine for protecting the netbook from bumps and handling. </p>

 <p> Ok, I'm a confirmed cat staff person so I just had to have this netbook cover. Yes, anyone can get a black or other multicolor netbook case but when is the last time you saw one like this?I get more comments when I take out my netbook. Surprises me how many other cat staff people are out there. One great advantage is at the airport security lines. Can't tell you how many security agents smiled when they saw me put in in the xray machine line. Guaranty no one else will mistake this cover for their netbook.Netbook case is well made, just the right size for my 10" netbook. I love the kitty front and back image on the case.If you love cats, you have got to get this netbook case. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Extremely cute and functional laptop sleeve that fits my Gateway NV73A17u 17.3" laptop perfectly </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Overall, I love this laptop sleeve, and it fits my newGateway NV73A17u 17.3-Inch Laptop (Satin Black)perfectly.  Below are some details about the qualities of this particular sleeve.  Keep in mind, of course, that this is a sleeve, not a case.  It is primarily intended to be inserted into another bag, though it can be carried/used on its own.AESTHETICS:The design is incredibly cute.  I was a bit worried from the picture that it was a screenprinted design that would flake off with time, but it's integrated into the material just like the patterns on other neoprene cases.  There is a front and back image, and the images are complementary.  I will take and post a picture of both sides, as the product description only shows the front image.  The colors are bright and clear.FUNCTIONALITY:The sleeve has two zippers, which is nice if you plan to tuck a mouse (no pun intended) or charging cable in, as it allows you to partially open the case at any point in the zipper.  The zipper track is coated to avoid scratching your device, a nice feature that many sleeves neglect.  Additionally, this sleeve has metal loops on either end of the zipper track.  This allows you to attach a strap (such as theSkooba R730-202 Superbungee Strap--the Black/Pink variant matches nicely) if you want to use this sleeve as a quick case for toting the laptop around.  The sleeve, so long as you put only the laptop and its battery inside, is TSA-friendly; you don't have to remove the sleeve when you go through security at the airport.FIT:This fit my 17.3" laptop snugly but still allowed enough stretch for me to tuck the charger and a mouse (again, no pun) inside. </p>

 <p> I bought this 10.2&#34; Kitty to Go cover to fit on my tablet to keep it from getting scratched. I've tried book type cases & no matter how well taken care of, something always seems to sneak in to try to scratch my screen eventually. I think this type of case will take care of that problem since it zips all the way around. Fits my iPad 2 just fine. I plan on upgrading to a 10.1&#34; Android soon & it looks like there's still plenty of room in there to put that one in instead. The material seems cushy enough to protect a tablet & the picture on this is very cute. I love the claw marks & the little mouse on the back. All in all, a nice cover. </p>

 <p> I needed a case fast so I picked out a cheap one until I could get a more durable one later. I am actually happy with this purchase and I don't plan on buying another. it's very nice quality and very vibrant and cute. people ask me about it all the time! </p>

 <p> 'Anti-Shock System' Is A Joke, But Otherwise Adorable </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I have been looking for a good zip case that actually has some protection from dropping, but this one (for my 10.1" tablet) was extremely loose, baggy, held a lot of air in the emptiness after being zipped shut, and has NO extra padding at all. It may be good to use if you are super careful when carrying around your device, but don't expect it to protect anything. Aside from that, I love the adorable graphics, and I may try to fit my laptop in it, as some reviewers seem to be using it for that. </p>

 <p> The Cover Kitty sleeves definitely are eye catching.  This one fits my Acer Aspire 10.1" netbook just fine with a little bit of room to spare, but not enough to put any accessories.It's made of a kind of rubber/cloth material(neoprene) much like thick spandex- if I can use that analogy.  It smells like rubber when one takes it out of its wrap, but then quickly dissipates.  I like the feel, and it appears durable, time will tell.I still wouldn't want to drop my book.  The sleeve's more for protection vs. mild bumps, bruises, nicks and scratches, perhaps, even light moisture, but not a whole lot.  It's mostly for style.The other side of the sleeve has the rear view of the cat and mouse.  The kitty's behind has a centered X on it which the kids find hilarious.  There's also attachments for a shoulder strap which is not included.An aside: for travel, I found a nifty, tough bag made by Swiss Army Knife which has a center dual compartment to hold both my netbook plus stuff like an external drive, plug, papers and such.  It comes with a shoulder strap, handles and, my favorite, a strap on the back to slide over the bars of my carry-on roller luggage.  I like to pack light ready for action when travelling, and this one is great for about $22.My Kitty sleeve I use daily on the bus, it fits nicely into my work bag. </p>

 <p> Fits my 13.3 retina display macbook pro </p>

 <p> Ordered the 13.3" version for my new macbook pro retina display version. Since the retina display version is slightly slimmer/smaller than its aluminum unibody counterpart, the case is just a tad on the tall side.  There's probably half an inch of wiggle room at the bottom (or top) of the case, but that's fine with me since it gives you the ability to slightly grip the top of the case.  The width of the case fits perfectly though.Great product, super cute print, love it! </p>

 <p> Only complaint is that it comes without a strap, but daughter found one at a garage sale, and there were attachments, so we're good to go!  Granddaughter especially liked the fact that the kitty backside was shown on one side of the product, and the kitty frontside on the other.  It's well made and fits her new laptop (15.6" screen) perfectly. </p>

 <p> I am  owner of ASUS Gamers Republic 15.6 with full keyboard. Which makes that laptop in to  size of 17 inc.So I am very glad that I've decided to get one of this cases. Even  though it's slim I can perfectly fit my laptop in it. And of cause it's sooooo girlyyyyyyyyyyy. I  just love it.The reason to buy soft case for me was that I am traveling a lot and there is to much hard time at  the security gates with all the electronic equipment and additional carry on. So I've decided to keep it in my back pack.Less  luggage and easy to get in and out. Take my advice and have one of those. </p>
