 <p> The main street films of the 30s and 40s were made outside the studio system, and meant to exploit all the elements banned by the Hayes Code, which had robbed many Hollywood productions of adult elements. Basically, the independent main streeters gave the public what some of them really wanted: sex, nudity, violence, drug abuse, and generally outrageous/illegal behavior. Most of them showed in run-down theaters in urban areas, where censorship was less intense, hence the term main street. Although a trove of these films was found in LA about 20-25 years ago, only 4 seem to have become readily available. Three are the classic drug hysteria films (Reefer Madness, Cocaine Fiends, and, the best of them, Marijuana: Weed With Roots In Hell). The 4th is Child Bride, which is vastly more sophisticated in terms of acting, set design, direction, and script (remember, this is relative to main street films). The film has some startling moments, and a weird verisimilitude because the star, Shirley Mills, looks the age of her character (about 13, although she was much older when she made the movie). The print seems identical to the UCLA archive print that was available on VHS. It has identical glitches. However, it is genuinely uncut and, overall, in good condition, especially compared to some of the horrendous prints of the 3 drug films that have been circulated on tape and DVD. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the film is how many of its elements appear in a classy art-house film like Songcatcher. Maybe the line between art and exploitation is a lot thinner than one imagines it to be.Given the price and quality of the print, and its historical significance, this DVD is really quite a bargain. </p>

 <p> Make no mistake about it folks, this is TRASH with a capital T!Essentially, this is one of those horrid exploitation flix of the 1930s that bypassed the Hays Code by pretending to be "educational" but were really trashy tales of drugs, sex, and crude violence that would not have otherwise been allowed. At best, such films are good for unintended belly laughs-at worst you have things like this that provide belly aches!"Child Bride" involves "Hillbilly" mountaineers who like to marry "younguns" and the "schoolmarm" who tries to stop the odious practice. The title role is played by 12 year old Shirley Mills. She is rather charming, but one has to wonder what kind of parents would allow their young dotters to appear in such a film!She is seen mostly in revealing clothing and in one scene goes skinny dipping with her young boyfriend (for the record, this is shown from a distance in the one concession to good taste). Basically, she is doing what she can to go to the primitive school and get by in the bucolic environment. However, the subhuman dirty grown "men" of the area want her for their own evil purposes and try to lynch the schoolmarm for trying to educate the yahoos against the disgusting and immoral practice. Things get worse when her drunk pappy dies and her mother is blackmailed into giving the dotter away to one such filthy pervert. What happens? You'll see.If Mountianeers had their own advocacy groups, they would have buried this long ago! Aside from Shirley Mills and her mama (if you also count her decent young boyfriend who is also about 13 years old and the brave midget), the "Hillbillies" are shown in pure stereotype as the lowest order of subhuman element in the United States. These goons even don Klan sheets for a lynching party and one character actually uses the n-word (rare during the Hays code era). It's a wonder this didn't reignite the Civil War!The acting is atrocious as is often the case for this genre and it would fall into the "so bad it's good" category of Ed Wood and Rudy Ray Moore's laughable trashfests. But the subject matter is too loathsome for unintended laughter and the film is just gross. Ed Wood's "Plan 9 From Outer Space (aka Grave Robbers From Outer Space) is usually considered to be the worst movie ever made. Anyone who sees "Child Bride" would agree that "Grave Robbers" should abdicate it's dubious throne on that one! This makes the latter look like "Gone With the Wind!"There is a scene early in the film with Shirley Mills feeds slop for the hogs. That is a good metaphor and description of the movie "Child Bride." </p>

 <p> Intriguing CharactersNo this isn't a documentary about 21st century Utah or a grindhouse exploitation flick as the posters and DVD covers imply.'Child Bride' is a surprisingly touching and powerful film. The production quality is very high and the characters are very intriguing.Set in the rural mountains of an unknown state where people are dirt poor and uneducated we must admire their resilience and family bonds.Much of it reminded me of 'VC Andrews' novel 'Heaven' except this time we're not routing for there to be any incest.The local school teacher Miss Carol has devoted her life to ending child marriage. She even refuses to marry her fianc&eacute; an assistant district attorney until he successfully petitions the governor to sign a law against it.But at the same time we can see the train wreck already coming for an innocent nymphet Jennie and her friend Freddie. (no Ys in this movie)Predictably after a series of unfortunate events Jennie is forced into child marriage with a dirty old man.I said it's predictable that Jennie will encounter conflict but we still feel very deeply for her and the other characters.SPOILER WARNINGIn the final moments of the film during Jennie's wedding night Miss Carol's fianc&eacute; proudly posts the new law banning child marriage. Miss Carol is delighted that the law came into affect 3 days ago thus voiding Jennie's marriage.I expected the couple to rush in and save Jennie on her wedding night. But instead Jennie is saved by her 12 year old boyfriend Freddie simply killing her husband in cold blood and the film closes with him saying that now someday Jennie can be his wife.Not that we're crying for the dead pervert but this seems to be stating that vigilante justice and not the law defeats evil? </p>

 <p> That's a good review by cookieman.  He covered most of what the film is about, so there is no need for me to repeat the story.  Instead, I would like to comment on the undeserved notoriety of this film.Much has been written about Shirley Mills' skinny dipping scene in this movie.  The main controversy being that she was underaged when the movie was made.  Her character, Jenny Colton, is a twelve-year-old girl living with her parents in Thunderhead Mountain.  One day, Jenny and her friend decide to go skinny dipping in a secluded pond.  In the scene, only Jenny gets naked.  The boy, Freddy, stays on the banks looking away from Jenny.Ok, so what you really want to know is just how explicit the nudity was.  One of Jenny's breasts was exposed very briefly as she was removing her dress.  All other nudity in that scene shows Jenny swimming naked.  You get to see her buttocks.  But really not much else due to her being underwater and the camera view is from above.In my opinion, all the hype about this scene is unwarranted.  I do not even think that based on this scene alone, that the film should get an R rating today.  What would give the film an R rating is the subject matter.  The nudity is not at all disturbing.  But the subject matter, or the story, is very much so.In that time and in that place, it was common for much older men to marry younger women.  And by "younger", I mean girls as young as 12.  The main antagonists, Jake Bolby, blackmails Jenny's mother in order to get her consent to marry Jenny.  Jake basically tells the mother that she will be framed for murder unless she agrees to let him marry Jenny.  To me, if there is anything disturbing about this movie, it would be the story. </p>

 <p> According to the `edjumacational' feature Child Bride (1938), there were approximately four main activities to involve yourself in if'n you were a middle aged male resident of Thunderhead Mountain, and they were (in no particular order) making moonshine, drinking moonshine, fighting, and courting underage girls, none of which holds any particular appeal to me, but hey, to each his own.  Directed by Harry Revier (Son of Tarzan, The Lost City), the film stars, in her silver screen debut, Shirley Mills, who would later appear in the classic John Ford/Henry Fonda feature The Grapes of Wrath (1940) in the role of Ruthie Joad.  Also appearing is Bob Bollinger, in his only feature (no surprise there), Warner Richmond (Huckleberry Finn, The Lost Jungle), and Don Barrett aka Angelo Rossitto (Freaks, The Corpse Vanishes), whom most may remember as the diminutive half of the entity known as Masterblaster from the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985).Shirley Mills plays Jennie Colton, a young, sweet, baby faced, barefoot girl who looks all of about twelve and wears tattered dresses about two sizes too small.  Jennie lives with her parents Ira and Flora on Thunderhead Mountain, where her father, in a partnership with a nasty individual named Jake Bolby, runs a hooch mill.  Jennie attends classes with her best friend Freddie (Bollinger), both of whom are sweet on each other, in a one room school house with pigeons in the rafters.  As I said, Jennie's a good-natured girl (and smart, too), but she's also kind of a nag, not to mention a snitch, especially when it comes to Freddie and his school work (Freddie thinks it's a bunch of hooey).  Jennie's teacher, a native of the area who went away to get an education and has since returned, bristles at the common local practice of older men marrying underage girls, and when she's not teaching she's trying to rally the women in the community against such unions (in vain, I might add), which only serves to anger up the men folk.  In an effort to put an end to her meddling ways, the men, with Jake as the ringleader, hold a tar and feather party, with the teacher as the guest of honor, but Ira manages to put a stop to things before they get too far.  I should also mention Jake was recently forced out of his joint moonshine venture by Ira due to Jake's penchant for abusing the employees, particularly a dwarf named Angelo (Rossitto) and a simpleton named Happy.  Jake, who's had his eye (both of them, to be specific) on Jennie for awhile, plots his revenge, and circumstances eventually lead up to him strong arming the Coltons into giving consent for Jennie to be his bride so he can get his pedophilic groove on...I learned a number of things from this film including (but not limited to) the following;1. When courting an underage girl, a rag doll is an appropriate gift.2. Blackmail is an extremely effective way to get yourself a wife, particularly one who is under the age of consent.3. It's difficult to study in a school where pigeons occupy the rafters due to the constant threat of being pelted with bird droppings.4. The only decent clothes (i.e. clothes without ridiculously huge, gaping holes or tears) mountain folk seem to possess is that which they wear to weddings and funerals.5. If a group of men donning potato sacks on their heads come calling in the middle of the night, it's best not to answer the door.6. Not all nude bathing sequences in movies are erotic.7. Never cross a dwarf as they can really hold a grudge.This is one of those films from way back when that, under the guise of an educational feature, claimed its intent supposedly to illuminate a practice the general population would find deplorable (child marriages in this case), but the reality was exploitation pure and simple.  You see, due to the censorship laws at the time (this was way before the ratings system was ever enacted), there were a whole lot of things you couldn't show or depict in films, particularly nekidness of any kind.  One way around this was to claim your feature was an educational film.  As far as Child Bride, it's probably one of the more lurid and creepier early exploitations films I've seen, but then again I really haven't seen that many.  The most uncomfortable sequence for me was a lengthy and unnecessary bit involving Shirley Mills disrobing and bathing in a pond.  At first it seemed like we wouldn't see much, as due to some carefully positioned leaves on a shrub, our view of her nekkid form is slightly obscured...but then we see a whole lot more as she's swimming around nekkid as can be...with the main antagonist Jake leering on from high atop a ridge.  I'm unsure how old Ms. Mills was at the time this movie was made, but she definitely looked the age she portrayed, that of about twelve.  Now I'm no prude, and looking at the nekkid form of another human doesn't particularly bother me (especially if that form belongs to someone like Mira Sorvino...homina homina), but gazing upon nekkidness of anyone under a certain age makes me feel uneasy.  Another scene that put me off a bit was when Jake came around courting Jennie, presenting her with a rag doll as a present, and talking about how he's going to make her his wife.  Talk about things that make you go eww...the funniest part in the film for me comes during a funeral of all things.  It seems the recently departed died under mysterious circumstances, but most in attendance seem to have an idea who most likely helped the man along his way to the great unknown.  As the minister preaches on, he makes some reference to how the mourners shouldn't fret over the soul of the recently departed, but more so for that of the person responsible, to which a number of people direct their gaze towards the person they believe responsible, all of them looking at the same individual.  The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from this `throbbing drama of shackled youth', that being shoddy, overly melodramatic and just this side of amateurish, while the story seems to ramble along happily (or haplessly) from one creepy sequence to another.  All in all I found this to be a curious (i.e. sleazy) bit of celluloid that was both repugnant and humorous within the brazenness of its material, and one that will appeal to the more die-hard exploitation fan, but not so much to more general audiences.  I gave this film a three star rating  particularly because it actually made me feel something (uncomfortable is a feeling) along with providing a few laughs while wallowing around within its own sleaze.The picture quality on this Alpha Video DVD release is rough at times, displaying a decent amount of obvious wear and tear, but I've seen worse (particularly from Alpha).  The audio comes through well enough, given the age of the feature.  As far as extras there's really not a lot, except for a handful of previews for a bunch of low budget, independent films.Cookieman108 </p>

 <p> Child Bride (1938) Was Based On A 1937 News Story About A 9 Year Old Bride In Tennessee.Child Bride (1938) starring Shirley Mills was shot in Columbia, California as an independent movie 73 years ago and is still alive and well, is currently sold in DVD video form and available for screening on home computers for free since the movie is now in the public domain.It is a famous movie made during the Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood made outside the big studio system which lasted and lasted and lasted. It is a classic in its way.Filmmakers created a story and a movie script, recruited a cast and technical crew, and shot the entire movie in two weeks in 1938.The movie is still alive and well. But truly a one of a kind movie and curious in many ways.In some ways, Child Bride (1938) was a preview of radical feminism and the puritanical parts of it proclaimed indignantly in the 1970's, 40 years later.The movie was about a crusading young female schoolteacher whose work results in laws outlawing marriage to very young girls.The star of the movie, Shirley Mills (1926 - 2010), lived into her 80's and died in 2010. She was a celebrity at "Nostalgia Conventions" which featured old movies and memorabilia and old stars from long ago like her. She appeared at booths at "Nostalgia Conventions" which sold DVD copies of Child Bride (1938), movie posters for it, and other collector memorabilia.(NOTE: See more about Shirley Mills interviews and comments about her 1938 "Child Bride" actor performance on the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) link part of the [...] page devoted to "Child Bride" (1938) which I wrote answering the question "Did "Child Bride" (1938) star Shirley Mills comment about the controversial parts of "Child Bride"?)The movie contains a brief and harmless "skinny dipping" nude swimming scene in which Shirley Mills and her pet dog are seen swimming in a mountain creek.In her later life, Shirley Mills claimed that the nude scene had been done by another actress slightly older than Shirley Mills in 1938 (she was 12 that year). That may or may not have been true, but the movie (in the public domain, anyone can see it free on a home computer using Google.Com to find it and gain access to it) shows close up shots of topless then 12 year old Shirley frolicking and splashing water on her dog.The movie was about distant, unpoliced places in the USA, about mountain people not constrained by the big government, big city puritanism which took over America after the World War I years, assisted by mass communications and high speed motorized transportation, which communicated and transported propaganda and government policing, and the righteous indignation and moralizing of an increasingly puritanical America.A movie nostalgia magazine called FilmFax (Summer 2010, No. 124 issue) described the history of the making of Child Bride (1938) in a history article written by Paul Holbrook, a movie historian who did extensive research about Child Bride (1938) and created the detailed[...] website which described the life of the star of the movie into her 80's, including photos, interviews, and a video interview of Mills in her old age.Child Bride (1938) starring Shirley Mills was thus an example of a movie created as a result of journalistic reporting.The Life Magazine couple shown in the Feb. 15, 1037 issue (Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Johns....she was 9, he was 22) went on to have a long life together. The groom died in his 80's and the bride died in her late 70's, cared for at the end of her life by a daughter who was born as a result of the 1937 marriage.-----------------------------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor </p>

 <p> I found out about this movie on AMC's 100 top most controversial films of all time and was curious to see what the big deal was about it, after watching it all I can say is if this movie were made today it would likely have a PG13 rating.The movie was made in 1938, a time when ( I guess) it was fairly common for young girls to get married often to older men. Shirley Mills the young girl in the movie was 12 years old when the movie was filmed and the controversy surrounds the fact that she appears nude for about 4 minutes, there's nothing in the film that you wouldn't see in a movie like Blue Lagoon so if your a pervert this movie is NOT what your looking for.The movie centers around a school teacher in a small mountain community on a mission to stop child marriage, like most small community's everyone knows everyone and there's the good folks, the decent folks, and of coarse the town low life. The movie is fairly predictable and none of the actors are great by any means but at least in my mind it does make the point it was intended to, 12 and 13 year old children shouldn't be married to 30 something year old men (if you want to call them men?).P.SAbout the young girl being nude, I'm not a big fan of children being nude or even having to be put in a situation like that at such a young age, this is one the very few times I think maybe it was appropriate and only be cause of the way it was done. The girl and young boy about the same age have going to the same swimming hole for years skinny dipping but the school teacher has told the young girl that her body is starting to change and she shouldn't be doing that anymore, she tells the boy this and while shes swimming he NEVER looks even once (child innocents) while the town low life is watching from a hiding spot, I think it drives home the point. </p>

 <p> Child Bride(1938) is a controversial, independently made drama. TV's Mystery Science Theater 3000 refused to show it! This film has an infamous, gratuitous scene where actress Shirley Mills swims nude for two minutes! The filmmakers used an adult woman to double for Mills in some shots. Mills was in the classic drama The Grapes of Wrath(1940). The rest of Child Bride is a decent film. There is some contrived storytelling and clunky dialouge, but it works. Director Harry Revier must've been the Ed Wood of the 1920's and 1930's. He also wrote the script for this film. Child Bride is only 62 minutes long.The late Shirley Mills did give an earnest performance as Jennie Colton. Bob Bollinger wasn't bad as Jennie's friend Freddie.Diana Durrell played Miss Carol, a teacher who wants child marriages to be abolished. Warner Richmond played Jake, the man who wants Jennie as his wife. Child Bride does have some laughable moments. There's a book titled Child Marriage is a Crime sitting near Jennie's bed! The song that Miss Carol teaches her students sounds terrible! The midget in this film played by Angelo Rossitto also played Master Blaster in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome(1985). The music score to Child Bride may have been stock music. It sounds like music from The Little Rascals! Child Bride is a decent drama from the 1930's. </p>

 <p> Rather well cast with faces I don't recognize. The subject matter is of a sensitive nature and ripe for exploitation, but in my opinion, the movie avoided situations unnecessary to the plot and only showed scenes that kept the story believable. I actually believe they showed some restraint. One difficult part was to show a realistic portrayal of &#34;hillbillies&#34; without stereotyping their behavior.The &#34;child bride&#34; actress appears underage and shows partial nudity, but no more that Brooke Shields did on two movies when she was young.There are parts of the movie where the producers/directors go out of their way to convince the audience that they are only doing this to bring attention to morally aberrant behavior in parts of our society. Probably the most subtle is near the beginning where the girl is sleeping in her bed with several books above her head, one of which is anti-child brides. It is expected that it was given to her by her teacher from the &#34;city&#34;, whose views get her into trouble with the locals. The irony about the books in her possession becomes more clear in a later classroom scene  when we see that that the girl does not appear to be at a level for reading and understanding the pertinent book. Of course, it does portray the intent of the movie and supports the teacher's dilemma.I would recommend this movie to cinema history buffs and persons interested in the difficulty of walking the thin line between exploitation subjects and realistic portrayals.Because of the sensitive subject matter and portrayals by the actors, this movie may not be appropriate for persons sensitive to child nudity and social behavior of a questionable nature. </p>

 <p> I watched this movie after seeing Louis Malle's, &#34;Pretty Baby&#34; by chance because it was free on Amazon Prime.  &#34;Child Bride&#34; was mentioned in several reviews.  C.B. is pretty cheesily acted with that over-exaggerated style of enunciation.  Shirley Mills sounded just like Shirley Temple when she sings &#34;On the Good Ship Lollipop&#34;.  But S.T. was like 5 at the time.  Child Bride didn't bother me as much as Pretty Baby.  I don't know how that film got made and was extremely disturbed by the content. </p>

 <p> Child Bride (Harry Revier, 1938)I've been looking for Child Bride ever since reading about it multiple times back when I was reading a lot about the Hays Commission (for those of you unaware, the Hays Commission were the forerunners of the modern-day MPAA). Now that I've finally tracked a copy down and seen it, all I can do is wonder how on earth this movie not only got made, but got released at a time when the Hays Commission had more power than at any time until the ratings system was introduced in 1968. If you tried to make this movie today, as a shot-by-shot remake, you'd be arrested. And I mean that literally.Shirley Mills (The Grapes of Wrath) stars in her first screen role as Jennie Colton, a nubile girl from the Ozarks who's gettin' on toward marryin' age-- which, in those parts, seems to be around eleven or twelve. (Mills was actually sixteen at the time the film was released.) She's still living in blissful innocence, frolicking with her best friend (who's starting to see her as something more than a friend), slopping the hogs, going to school at the village's one-room schoolhouse. Until, that is, one of her father's shady business partners hatches a convoluted scheme to turn young Jennie into his wife. (Another point to be made here is that if you were to try and remake this film today, said plot's intricacy, and the inevitable complications that would arise in a modern script, would turn this into a movie three times the length of Child Bride, which runs slightly over an hour.) Jennie, when the plan is revealed in its full atrocity, is none too pleased with the idea of marrying a guy who's old enough to be her father (her grandfather, really, but when you've got fifty-year-olds marrying twelve-year-olds, you know), but what can she really do about it? Meanwhile, the village schoolmarm, who's engaged to a hot young prosecutor who's angling for a spot as district attorney, brings pressure to bear on him to outlaw child marriage in the Ozarks. Will the bill go through in time for Jennie to live happily ever after-- or at least as happily ever after as it's possible to live in a village where the main export seems to be illegally-made moonshine?Yeah, as you can tell from the synopsis I gave above (and that's just the tip of the iceberg-- impressive for an hour-long movie), stereotypes run thick and fast here. These days, they're good for about one derisive laugh, but then again, that was probably true in 1938 as well. If you put that aside, though, it's not a bad little plot, and the script has that sort of appeal one finds when slumming with, say, the odd Adam Sandler movie. Where Child Bride veers off into that territory between "oddly uncomfortable" and "outright illegal" is in an extended scene featuring Shirley Mills wearing nothing but a creek. Suffice to say that Revier-- who would not make another film for fifteen years after this, despite having a prolific career in the silents-- leaves nothing at all to the imagination. It's an absolute shock, and it may be even more so today than it would have been seventy years ago. And again I say-- the Hays Commission got after Clara Bow for flashing too much leg, but gave this a pass? It's nice to see that the American ratings system has always been as arbitrary, and as outright stupid, as it is today.I'm not as entirely sure on the law as I'd like to be, and since even possessing this movie may set you up for an arrest on some very nasty charges, for obvious reasons I can't recommend it. Still, if "a friend" of yours happens to come into possession of a copy "for research purposes", it merits viewing as a curiosity of an earlier, and much weirder, time in the history of Hollywood. We Americans obviously weren't nearly as straitlaced back then, as much as we tried to put up the front. (It is also interesting that, aside from one guy who skews the data, the film rates highest at IMDB among women over the age of forty-five.) **  </p>

 <p> Do not be alarmed! The loud thud you are getting to hear is merely the sound of your jaw dropping to the floor while watching Child Bride (1938). And before the credits roll, you will know that you have truly entered a twilight zone from the gutter cinema of yesteryear.Of course, in 1938 movies were deep in the law of the Hays Code, and the only films which managed to subvert Will Hays' dos-and-don'ts-list were the exploitation features. That is because they contained an "educational, moral message" for the masses.Child Bride was a government funded film which begins it's sermon with: "These child marriages must be stopped!" Predictably, the film then wallows in its own tawdry agenda. Written and directed by the rightfully forgotten hack, Harry Reiver, Child Bride is a ripe candidate for one to the most disturbing examples of unintentional weirdness."Here is a page from the Book of Life... in Thunderhead Mountain. We do not aim to ridicule the back yonder folk, but if our story abolishes their child marriages, then it will have served its purpose." If the music from Deliverance (1972) starts coming to mind, then take it as a warning: Be afraid. Be very afraid. The only thing missing is the horror horn and fear flasher from Chamber of Horrors (1966).Ma and Pa Colton (Dorothy Carroll & George Humphreys) don't like no child marriage. They even have a book lying on their front porch saying it's a crime, which is a tad ironic since their eleven year-old Jennie (Shirley Mills) does lotsa provocative stretching and shows plenty o' leg in her homemade miniskirt, cut up to her crotch (the `dress' looks like it was cut with lopsided scissors), while doing her early morning chores before trotting off to school.Jennie's sort-of mountain boyfriend Freddie (Bobby Bolinger) stops by to accompany her to school, but not before they engage in adolescent hijinks and argue like an old married couple after Jennie takes a tumble in the hog den.The school marm, Miss Carol (Diana Durrell) is on a mission to stop all the child marriages taking place on Thunderhead Mountain. "Miss Carol's sayin' dangerous stuff to our women folk," says one mountain fellar as he spits out a wad of Beech-nut. "Isn't it better to have a woman for 30 years than a child for 15?" asks Miss Carol. "Child marriages must go!" (This line is spoken directly to the camera, just in case you missed it). This position earns Miss Carol the enmity of Jake (Warner Richmond) who has it in mind to take little Jennie for his... Child Bride!Miss Carol has a Yankee lawyer, named Charles (Frank Martin, the poor man's square-jawed leading man) for a fiancee. Charles is trying to stick his nose where it don't belong when he tries to put an end to child brides. What is Jake and his henchmen gonna do? Well, they're gonna put on some black robes, light their torches, and show us what the Amerikkka al-Qaeda looked like in 1938.Jake and his henchmen abduct poor, well-meaning Miss Carol (in a silk nightie, strategically ripped to show off thighs and collar bone) and, just when it looks like the scene's developing into a precursor to Catherine Deneuve taking a lashing against a tree, Angelo (dwarf Angelo Rossitto from Freaks) shows up to save the day, with Pa Colton bringing up the flank!Next, throw in a skinny dipping scene with the eleven year-old leading lady baring it in the buff, as Jake salivates from afar (nope, not kidding). Pa Colton is a considerable roadblock to Jake's pedo ambitions. Naturally, with Pa being the hero, one would think he's a paragon of virtue. You'll realize differently when he whallops his mouthy ma (who always seems to be on the verge of a major wardrobe malfunction).You may have to flip a coin to determine what's more disturbing: the protagonist beatin' on his wife or the camera's leering close-up of Jennie's cleavage (which boggles the mind since, at eleven, she has no cleavage).A hillbilly wedding ceremony between Jake and Jennie indicates a descent into yester-Hell, but it is essentially a late thirties exploitation oater, so a happy ending is in store. Of course, that depends on your interpretation of "happy" because before the never-thought-it-would-end ending, Jennie and Freddie engage in some lip to lip contact, strongly indicating a child bride to child groom consummation to come!Strongly advised to be seen with nothing less than an entire case of Pabst Blue Ribbon. Cheap beer is the only way to endure this one.* my review originally appeared at 366 weird movies. </p>
