 <p> The second book set in Bardville, WY. was equally as good as the first. The seamless storyline was amazing. You learn about the two main characters in Book 1 as you read about Boone and Cambria. Then, Jessa and Cully's story becomes the main story. McLinn continues telling us about the Bardville characters and landscape and how they all work together to make a community of people who care about one another. I love the fact that you know who she will write about next. The relationships seem real. The characters are revealed as different people just as you'd expect them to be in a circle of friends. I am enjoying all of McLinn's books. Catch up! You're missing out on some great reading full of adventures and passion. </p>

 <p> I loved the characters is book one. In book two Cully took my heart. There is more suspense than in book one, but both of them are terrific, the characters well developed. It's a lovely book with great romance. </p>

 <p> I love this trilogy, but this one is my favorite. The sizzle that is Cully and Jessa is AMAZING. Their romance was a lot of give and take, and it never felt like the author lost her pace with it. I'm so glad that I found this series, and I look forward to reading more by Patricia McLinn. </p>

 <p> Perfection </p>

 <p> I really liked Cully...but Jessa I just wanted to strangle her! She pissed me off throughout the book; she never even acted like she had any feelings for Cully and always keep him at a distance. Definantely not someone you would even want to marry or have a physical relationship with! If you feel like putting your hate on for the heroine go for it! </p>
