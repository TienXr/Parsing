 <p> I come from a traditional Swiss family so we have swiss cheese fondue and/or beef fondue for most holidays.  My wife and I were looking to break out of the traditional recipes we use and found some of the best fondue we've ever eaten in this book. </p>

 <p> Think outside of the traditional fondue box </p>

 <p> I grew up with fondue parties.  I saw this book and thought it would be a great weekend dinner to introduce the kids to fondue.  We love gruyere cheese so definitely trying the fondue neuchateloise first.  As a kid, we only ever had oil fondue, so I can't wait to try some of these other ones.  Bread dipped into a cheese fondue just sounds like the best food ever! </p>

 <p> Great recipes - can't wait to try them! </p>

 <p> In our household, we have a cheese fondue a few times a year. Everyone in the family likes it and it's always a fun event. We even use a 40-year old fondue set. Now I'm going to channel my inner Don Draper and expand the repertoire with some of these great recipes from &#34;Mad Fondue&#34;. We might even bring in some friends and organize a party along the lines of some of the fun suggestions from author Vikk Simmons. This book was a fun find that will be getting a lot of use in our kitchen. </p>

 <p> These recipes take me back to my childhood when my family would all gather around the fondue pots and really have fun. It was as much about the food as it was the company. These recipes are all worth trying and will be a huge hit at your next fondue or should I say &#34;FUNdue&#34; party. Nothing like a cheesy joke for a book full of cheesy goodness.I personally loved the Steak de Fromage and Quick Tomato Cheese Fondue. If you have never tried fondue before it is a must. Follow the authors advice and buy the right brand of fondue pots. Having the proper equipment makes a fondue party so much more fun. </p>

 <p> What a fun book!  I have a set of fondue pots that were my mother's, and I've never known exactly what to do with them.  This book gives you all the instructions and a ton of recipes.  It even has ideas on how to give a fondue party!  Highly recommend. </p>

 <p> This book is very interesting. It has lots of information on the history of fondue, the pots, tips to make your fondue and much more. After having read this book you will be ready to surprise your guest with the best mad fondue party!We have fondue several times during the cold month of winter but we always have the already made kind you buy at the grocery store. Now I can't wait to make my own. There are several recipes that got my attention: the fondue Neuchateloise,  the three cheese red wine fondue and the dark chocolate frangelico fondue as dessert. </p>
