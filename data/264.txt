 <p> This dvd is a video record of this groups early days and demonstrates why this great group is still performing today to millions around the world. I first saw this group ( in the USA) in September 1970, just a few days after this concert was performed in Europe. They left a lasting impression on me right up to the present and still sound great today. A &#34;must&#34; for any Moody Blues fan </p>

 <p> There are several concert DVDs currently available for the Moody Blues, but this is the one I find to be the most satisfying - much more so than the others.  Why?  For one thing it's the only DVD that features the 5-man line-up that made them famous, i.e. the line-up of their first seven albums.  This is a "warts and all" one-take performance, and I prefer those to the overly polished concerts of the more modern DVDs.  More recent Moody Blues DVD concerts have two drummers, and while the second drummer does a great job, this DVD shows the band performing as they did during the peak of their fame - and I feel drummer Graeme Edge does an outstanding job on his own.As to drawbacks of the DVD/film itself, to me there aren't many.  I'd have liked a somewhat longer concert, but this is apparently the entire concert as played that day, at that festival.  One of the songs - a Mike Pinder composition called "The Sunset" shows only the crowd as we hear the audio portion.  It would have been nice to see the band during "The Sunset", but I'm guessing that the video portion of the band was lost or not recorded, while the audio recording was preserved.  If so, then I applaud the decision to include the song as an "audio only" plus crowd scenes (rather than a blank screen) - better to include the song that way, then to drop it entirely.  Also, some people object to the final song using visuals from both the day's concert performance as well as earlier ones; I understand that objection, but I actually think the "video montage" works well for one song (I'm glad they didn't do the entire DVD that way, however) - and it IS the proper audio track for that song (i.e. the one they performed at the Isle of Wight that day).All in all, this is not perfect, the Moodys make a few minor mistakes here and there, but to me this is the perfect preservation of a Moody Blues concert when they were at their best and most "real".  Thus this gets 5-stars all the way, because this is an immensely satisfying, very real show, and because there are no other filmed and recorded full concerts (that I'm aware of) of the Moody Blues with the 5-man line-up for which they are famous. </p>

 <p> The 'mood' of the times is really captured well on this DVD, and of course the music of the Moodies is top notch; A truly classic 'live' performance, that will transcend time and take you back to an era long gone, but certainly not forgotten... at least not for me! An excellent opening 'feature' with the various band-members precedes their segment of the festival, and informative liner notes are included. </p>

 <p> A special thanks to Eagle Rock Entertainment for releasing this dvd.  If you are a fan of the core 7 albums and the five members who created that wonderful music, then you are going to love watching this dvd. For me, the Isle of Wight concert was basically England's version of Woodstock with over a half a million people attending.The band's performance is a little rough around the edges, but you can see how all five members show their delight and excitement and even a little fear in performing in front of that huge audience.  Especially fun to watch perform is Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge.  New interviews with the members are included (miss Ray).  The interview with Mike Pinder talking about and demonstrating the mellotron is fascinating.Also fun to watch is the band performing songs that are not currently on their tour lists (Gypsy). Currently, at the end of their concerts, John Lodge always thanks the audience for following them on their journey, and it is wonderful to have this recording taken from around the beginning of that journey.So if you are a fan of British rock or a die-hard fan of the Moodies, this dvd is a must have.  Especially if you are one of the Troubadour (Justin Hayward) fans. </p>

 <p> I envy the people old enough to have attended this concert. Its sheer ecstasy for any Bluer to watch these guys in action 4 years after their first Album release, not counting the (Go Now) album and they are at the height of Moody Blue fever. How beautiful a setting to watch them in, no doubt puffing a joint would have added to the ambiance but their they were, raw, edgy and ripping it up for the crowd.  I don't think the Moody Blues ever matched this one fantastic moment in their concert history. They have always given their all but here they seemed to feel almost overwhelmed by the enthusiasm.  Dam I wish I was there. If their is one piece of Nostalgia on record of the Moody Blues,this is it. This is the Moody Blues all 5 of em and being just singers in a rock n roll band. No pretension, no egos.We will never see a group like them again. </p>

 <p> What a treat for us fans of the real, legendary Moody Blues, at their peak, when Mike Pinder still graced the stage with Justin Hayward and the others. The Moodies produced seven wonderful albums between 1967 and 1972 before Mike Pinder left the band (and took the magic with him) and the rest of the guys carried on in a decidedly different musical direction. They were "The Moody Blues" thereafter, playing along with various keyboard players, drummers, extra singers and orchestras, to much acclaim and financial success. Plenty of videos of this whole extravaganza, for sure! But until now never any video of the real Moodies. So this DVD is priceless. Watch it and enjoy the Moody Blues live. And maybe, just maybe, this release might inspire the five Moodies to get together one more time for a concert reunion. There aren't many bands left from the 60s-70s with all their members still around, but the Moody Blues are all still with us. So how about it Mike, Ray, Justin, John and Graeme? Please? </p>

 <p> I was very skeptical about what to expect. Therefore I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this. What I loved about concerts in the 60's was what Justin said that it was all about the music and not being stars or money ( to a point) and to me that fun aspect shines thru. I particularly enjoyed the interviews before the actual concert especially Mike's explanation of the Mellotron. Kind of fun to see amps labeled for the Who and Tull when camera shooting from behind the band. Ray thomas, who I always assumed was very calm onstage,  was a wild man and in fact it was funny to see Justin so in control and serious at all times. It was more of a rock concert with Grahme extremely powerful on the drums. The sound was quite good and performances better than I was led to beleive. They were a true band in the sense that they all fed off of each other . All in all a real find and a must for any Moody's fan. </p>

 <p> "Nights in White Satin" is a truly timeless classic rock ballad. It will be played until the end of time. The Mellotron, second only to the Theramin  as Rock's most curious instrument, was never more tastefully integrated into song than through the masterful playing of Mike Pinder on mostly ethereal compositions that were frequently weighted down with cosmic lyrics and spoken word poetry. They took album making seriously and many actually work as song cycles unto themselves.The Moody Blues were one groovy British band whose leader Justin Hayward not only took to donning medallions, but also played guitar with a highly melodic and accomplished style. His solo on "Ride My See Saw" is flawless. His acoustic strumming on "Question" rivals Pete Townshend for speed and fluidity.No other band quite captured the sixties patchouli scented zeitgeist like the Moodies. "Legend of a Mind" with it's sing along chorus about LSD proselytizer Timothy Leary, and Left to Right stereo pans during the flue/Mellotron interlude, may be the finest headphone song ever to listen to after blowing a doobie!Plus, singer-flutist Ray Thomas sported a porn mustache long before porn, Mark Spitz, Magnum, or John Oates brought then to wider audience.So why aren't these guys in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?"Foul!" cry the fans of the band who have seen them overlooked year after year. Surely they shouldn't be lumped in with Chicago, Yes, Rush, and Kiss (among others) who not only have sold millions of records, but have also established a loyal fan base that still comes out to see them when they tour. Can't the Rock and Roll Hall take another "Tuesday Afternoon" and reconsider this band?Perhaps this new Blu-ray release from Eagle Vision might inspire such a reconsideration.What is essentially a expanded repackaging of filmmaker Murray Lerner's extensive Isle of Wight Festival footage, The Moody Blues Live at the Isle of Wight Festival captures the Moodies at the height of their popularity. Considered "England's Woodstock" this concert featured many of the top acts of the day (the Who, Joe Cocker, and others) who have since had a video treatment similar to the one given here.The newly recorded footage with the band recollecting the time and concert is terrific stuff - wish there was more of that. The Moodies deserve a more comprehensive evaluation than what is provided here. Drummer Greame Edge, bassist John Lodge, keyboardist Mike Pinder, and guitarist Justin Hayward prove themselves to be articulate re-tellers of the time in which that concert was made. It's a shame Lerner didn't broaden his questions to ask about the London music scene, recording technology of the time, and competitiveness of the band. I am sure the answers from this crew would have been fascinating. Clearly these are all thoughtful guys.Instead what we have is a mostly straightforward performance by the Moody Blues of some of their biggest hits in front of one of the largest audiences in history - all done with a PA system that would now be used for a Sunday church service. So the interest here is primarily historical and for fans.The video does remind the viewer of what a unique band the Moodies were. They took folk music to a more cosmic level while keeping it intimate and personal. With the Mellotron, they created something entirely their own. I loved the This is the Moody Blues anthology, it is full of great songs. "Watching and Waiting" in particular is one of the best songs of heartache in rock. It's easy to forget how great they were at the time. I suggest you revisit their music sometime soon and you too might agree.Not sure these accomplishments merit inclusion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they might be too much of their time and a bit too nuanced. The "classic rock" they peddled never really caught on and other progenitors, like ELP,  have not aged well as well. This video makes clear they were an accomplished band. Maybe even a great one!Recently I gave a re-listening to To Our Children's Children's Children, arguably their finest album. The tunefulness of their songs is striking compared to the music of today. That late 60's/70's was a once in my lifetime period of quality music output. While their melodies sometimes stray from being merely tuneful to being corny, songs like "Gypsy" "Eyes of a Child" and "Live to be a Hundred" still have a great deal of charm.While The Moody Blues Live at the Isle of Wight may not make a clear case for the inclusion debate it certainly makes a strong case for revisiting their music where the case might be stronger. </p>

Moody Blues fans from the 70s will L-O-V-E this video.  I guar-rone-tee  There is some very interesting background information about michael Pinder and his instrument- the Melotron? </p>

 <p> Je suis rest&eacute; perplexe et un peu d&eacute;u devant ce DVD, qui ne contient pas toutes les chansons du CD du mme titreLive At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970. Parmi les aspects positifs, on y trouve bien sr les grandes chansons comme "Gypsy", "Tuesday Afternoon", "Legend of a Mind", et des nouveaut&eacute;s de l'&eacute;poque comme "Turtoise and Hare" et "Question". Les versions sont excellentes. C'est le seul DVD o&ugrave; l'on peut voir Mike Pinder chanter "Melancholy Man", ce qui est tr&egrave;s impressionnant. De plus, le concert est pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute; d'entretiens individuels r&eacute;cents avec quatre des membres originaux, dont Mike Pinder (chauve, sans cravate), qui explique et d&eacute;montre comment le mellotron ajoute une musicalit&eacute; particuli&egrave;re et une atmosph&egrave;re &agrave; une m&eacute;lodie. Ailleurs, Justin Hayward avoue &agrave; Murray Lerner qu'il ne connaissait pas l'existence de ces archives de l'Isle of Wight et qu'il ignorait mme y avoir &eacute;t&eacute; film&eacute;. Pourtant leur performance de "Nights in White Satin" apparaissait d&eacute;j&agrave; sur le DVD collectif du concert de Wight, film&eacute; par le mme cin&eacute;asteMessage to Love: The Isle of Wight Festival - The Movie. Par ailleurs, certaines chansons du concert avaient &eacute;t&eacute; enregistr&eacute;es sans avoir &eacute;t&eacute; film&eacute;es, &agrave; une &eacute;poque o&ugrave; les cam&eacute;ras portatives de 16 mm ne captaient que les images et pas le son synchrone (contrairement aux camescopes), et le r&eacute;alisateur a du cr&eacute;er un accompagnement visuel pour pallier le manque d'images dans trois chansons du film: "Never comes the day" et "Sunset". A la fin, "Ride my See-Saw" fait l'objet d'un montage agaant combinant des images du groupe &agrave; diverses &eacute;poques. Parfois, les images ne sont pas synchronis&eacute;es avec la musique: on voit Justin Hayward jouer un accord de guitare qui ne correspond pas exactement &agrave; ce qu'on entend, ou on &eacute;vite de montrer clairement le chanteur (ou on le filme de dos, parce que les images proviennent en fait d'une autre chanson). Ray Thomas n'est pas interview&eacute; ici.Le DVD est n&eacute;anmoins pr&eacute;cieux car il n'a pas d'&eacute;quivalent et montre le groupe &agrave; son sommet. Le DVD (d&eacute;cevant) du concert "Lost Performance" &agrave; Paris &eacute;tait certes plus long, mais le groupe ne jouait pas vraiment et ne faisait que chanter sur certaines pi&egrave;ces pr&eacute;-enregistr&eacute;esThe Moody Blues - The Lost Performance: Live In Paris '70. Mais on comprend ici que nous avons droit aux seuls morceaux d'archives du festival de Wight ayant &eacute;t&eacute; sauv&eacute;s de l'oubli. C'est bien peu pour un groupe de cette envergure. Tout comme les Beach Boys entre 1968 et 1975, les Moody Blues &eacute;taient &agrave; leur sommet musical et cr&eacute;atif; mais aucune archive audio-visuelle ne nous les montre vraiment interagir sur sc&egrave;ne dans un concert complet. Ces quelques extraits sont une source rare. Les chansons du DVD sont compl&egrave;tes, avec quelques br&egrave;ves pr&eacute;sentations faites par Ray Thomas. Tous les autres concerts des Moody Blues disponibles en DVD datent des ann&eacute;es 1990 ou apr&egrave;s, alors que la formation &eacute;tait r&eacute;duite, sans la pr&eacute;sence vitale de Mike Pinder au mellotron ou au chamberlain. </p>

 <p> Maybe I just did not read the description carefully, but I was expecting a professional, video of the concert itself.  What it is, is a professional documentary that is only marginally informative.  It does have an interesting section showing Mike Pinder discussing the Mellotron and that is good.  The Moody's were not at the best in this concert (especially vocally) and the performance just seems a bit flat.  The video of the concert seems more like video from amateur and just kind of patched together.  I would not buy this video if I lost it. </p>

 <p> I was realy wanting to see Michael since I only got to go to the concerts after his departure. (10 visits in all)His only song was melancholy man.  I realy wanted to see have you heard since it is my fav of his.  Also I would have rather had the interviews as a separate thing instead of over the concert.  I would have been ecstatic if I would have gotten just the "entire" concert... without soo much crowd footage.  But maybe they were missing some bits and had to fill in.  Short sightedness on the filming crew.  If you are filming a concert you should have at least one camera on the group at all times. Man would I loved to have been sitting on one of the speaker towers with a modern 3ccd HD camcorder with a 20x optical zoom....  Oh well.  It is better than nothing, and if you are a Moody fan of any kind you must get this while they are still produced. </p>

 <p> I'm an old man now, but I was once young and enthused about popular music and live concerts.  I was lucky to see the Moody Blues for the first time back in 1972 when Mike Pinder was still with them.  Since then, I have seen them in concert several more times.  For many years they appeared in central florida with regularity.If you don't know, Mike Pinder played the mellotron, an "organ-like" instrument that could make their music sound like an orchestra.  In my opinion, it was a critical component in reproducing their sound in concerts.  So I always felt that first concert I saw was the best of the several I attended over the years.This DVD is a fun watch for someone like me who remembers youth.  It would not be as well received for a younger person, or someone inclined to be more critical.  It is not up to the quality of many other DVD concerts.  But these issues are explained in interviews included on the DVD.  I recommend it with these above comments noted.My opinion of The Moody Blues is very high.  Their recorded music played on a quality stereo is some of the best talent from an era of great popular recorded music.  I own seven of their first eight records on vinyl (and now CD), as well as 3 or 4 of the later releases without Mike Pinder.  My favorite is "Seventh Sojourn", but they're all worth owning. </p>

 <p> Even for those days this is not necessarily great video, considering Woodstock. However it is good to see so many positive and good reviews of this disk. The real value of this disk is the complete band and at a point where there skills are starting to flourish. Perhaps tyhe best concert footage of the group is the Red Rocks Concert. But that is not really an indication to me as to what this band was about and their real skill. To me this concert shows the real Moody Blues, one of a group that really was something greater than the sum of its parts. Having seen the Moody Blues in Toronto at Maple Leaf Gardens. They are not the same group without Mike Pinder and his songs and keyboard playing and vocals. Even this concert does not really show them at their full potential and greatness. What is most interesting is the honest comments particularly of Justin Hayward and particularly by Graham Edge about their misguided views about being able to change the world and the real coruption that became part of the music business. However that certainly does not take away from the obvious talent that made the Moody Blues what they were. The music they created as a unit is some the best anywhere, anytime. </p>

 <p> This is a rare look at the Moody Blues live in 1970. It is not a highly polished performance like their studio albums,but it is very good nonetheless. It starts with a 20 minute intro with present interview footage of John,Justin,Mike&Graeme,but sadly without Ray. The most interesting of this is Mike's demonstration of the mellotron and its interior workings.  Next comes about an hour of actual concert footage. Most of the concert is excellent,with the weakest song being "Tortoise and the Hare". To be honest,the mellotron is extremely hard to play live,and Mike gives it his best shot. " Melancholy Man" is an absolutely blistering performance. Other standout performances are "Never Comes the Day","The Sunset",and "Legend of a Mind". The encore,"Ride My Seesaw",is a compilation of footage from various concerts. Some of the concert film was lost,and this is most likely the reason for this. The dvd has only 10 songs,while the cd has 14, due to the fact that some film footage was lost [as mentioned in the dvd booklet]. After the concert are present day reflections from the band [once again ,no Ray]. The end of the disc has Graeme reciting "Late Lament".  This is an excellent look at early Moody Blues live. An absolute must for Moodies fans and for anyone who likes rock concerts that don't sound like they were done in the studio. There are no overdubs....this is a great raw performance. </p>

 <p> Just finished watching this, loud with the DTS track, and I could almost swear I could smell the pot smoke from the audience.  The concert footage is a great time capsule, and it's well worth the reasonable asking price.  It's a true representation of the classic line-up Moodies live, and although (as others have mentioned) they could be a little rough there's wonderful energy here, a true "live" performance by a band that looks a little intimidated at the magnitude of the event they're performing at.  As such there's a nervous enthusiasm that's very fun to watch. (Kind of amusing to see that they're apparently using the Who's and Jethro Tull's speaker stacks, at least that's what stenciled on them).  I wish the performance material was completely untouched, especially the "Ride my See-Saw" encore.  Instead it's been made into a montage of various clips of the song played by the band through the years.  It breaks the "time and place" ambiance, but as mentioned in other reviews perhaps the Isle of Wight footage wasn't complete.  Small quibble, and the opening new interviews, especially with Mike Pinder at the mellotron are very worthwhile.(BTW, for fans of the instrument there's a new documentary out on it's history called "Mellodrama - History of the Mellotron".  Haven't seen it yet, but can't wait). </p>
