 <p> I hope that Brea Brown is busy writing book 5 of the TSK series because this book ended in such a cliff hanger!  I am so wrapped up in Brice and Peyton's lives, yes they are my new Edward and Bella:). A few months ago I read the first TSK book and in less than a week had read the rest of the series.  Brea is active on Facebook and is such a genuinely nice person.  If you haven't read any of her books get busy reading because you will love them! </p>

 <p> I have enjoyed reading this book. I read until my battery went dead.  I was so engrossed in what was to happen next that my husband had to repeat his question to me three times.  Keep up the good work!  I'm looking forward to the next book. </p>

 <p> This is the 4th book in the Secret Keeper Series. If you haven't read the first 3.. what are you waiting for?  This series is for those of us who live in the real world. The world where sometimes co-workers are mean and vengeful. Pregnancy happens at the least opportune time. We can't seem to keep our foot out of our mouths. Kids keep us up all night. If you know what I'm talking about, then you need to be nose deep in this book. Peyton and Brice keep it real, and if they can hold onto their faith through it all.. then I can too. It sounds cheesy, but I did laugh out loud, shed a few tears and put my hand over my mouth in shock! Now.. get to reading! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Holding on.. for the sequel! </p>

 <p> If you are not familiar with The Secret Keeper series, then the only thing to do is to read the other volumes first. You will be very lost if you read this one without getting to know Peyton and Brice, and everyone else. It will be time well invested, I can assure you. Then come back and read this one because it is, without a doubt, the best one of the series, so far (the author has announced on FB that she's working on book 5, can't wait for it!).In The Secret Keeper Holds On we catch up to Brice and Peyton, and to the busyness of their lives-- their family life, Brice's calling as a pastor, Peyton's job at the gallery, their friends and extended family, the church members, and other new characters. It may seem a lot, but these secondary characters are very well crafted and do a great job of supporting the leads. And the main characters, Peyton and Brice, are so well developed that I feel like I know them (I've been following this series since last year). They are realistic-- they are funny, and sometimes comical, and very annoying at other times, and have faults, and sad moments, but also have generous, beautiful hearts that you can't help falling in love with. They are very attractive, especially Brice. ;)I've read reviews from other readers who think this series is religious in content, but it really isn't. It follows the life of a pastor, yes, but it's more about the day to day of ordinary people trying to do the best they can, and who can't relate to that?I wish I could comment on my favorite parts of this book 4, but I have so many I like, I'd probably be giving away major spoilers. There were some really funny moments (it *is* Peyton telling the story after all), and some really sad ones too, but overall, I loved reading this novel. Very, very well done! </p>

 <p> Pre-review background info....The Secret Keeper was the first book I read by Brea Brown and I have been hooked ever since. She creates very realistic characters  that are so fully developed, it's easy to forget that they only exist on paper. While I don't think you need to read the first three books in this series to appreciate TSK Holds On, you will be missing a lot of the character development that really is what makes these characters so endearing. Peyton and Brice have both matured, and seeing those changes (forwards, backwards, and sideways) is the fun. So, do yourself a favor and read the other books in this series first, then read this one, then read the rest of Brea's books, because they are all worth a look.Now, as for The Secret Keeper Holds On, there are several points in this book where my jaw dropped, or I gasped, or I yelled out in surprise while I was reading this. What can I say? Life for a married couple with 3 kids under the age of 2 and two jobs is going to be an adventure. And this book is definitely an adventure.Brice is a Pastor who is the type of person we all hope our religious leaders are like, because he always tries to see the good in people and wants to sincerely help everyone along their spiritual journey. He definitely has his moments, though, and it's nice to occassionaly see his rough edges because it makes him better than average, but still very human.  But, we all know that someone who is that good tends to ruffle the feathers of people who are holier than thou, which causes tension for both him and Peyton. A lot of tension, as a matter of fact. If you don't cheer and gasp at the same time at one particular Brice moment towards the end of the book, then you may need to check your pulse to make sure you are still alive. It is seriously that shocking, thrlling, and scary all at the same time. And there is that other Brice moment at the very end of the book that had me yelling, &#34;No, you can't end it like that!&#34; So, I was extremely relieved to read in the acknowledgements in the back that TSK 5 is planned.Peyton is a little insecure, a people please, and a bit of a hot heard, particularly when she feels her husband is being attacked. But, she has grown up quite a bit throughout this series and it was nice to see her learn how to manage her insecurites more. She still keeps secrets in the name of keeping the peace, but she is learning that sometimes talking things through, even when they aren't pleasant, is the better solution. It's also nice to see that she is getting a little inkling that there is more to her than just being the middle-child, people-pleaser, secret keeper that she thinks isn't quite up to her husband's level. She has quite a few jaw-dropping moments in this book, too. It's a wonder I didn't get drool over everything with how often my mouth was open while reading.But, don't get the idea that there are shocking things that happen just to be shocking, This is a slice of life book, and life can be full of surprises. You will definitely be able to relate to what happens to Peyton and Brice and you will be cheering for them all the way. </p>

 <p> Definitely a cliff-hanger!  I can't wait for the next one to come out.  The development of this book shows Brown's development as a writer in perfecting plot, transitions, and suspense.  Brice is definitely a dreamy and complicated dude, while Peyton's journey only makes me wonder who she will end up being as a complicated femalecharacter! </p>

 <p> This fourth installment of TSK is another fast-paced and engaging read about a couple in love, who have a lot of unexpected twists in store...Peyton and Brice are back, and now they have two more babies on their hands. With three kids under two, they have enough on their plate. Add in some new problems at the church and the gallery, not to mention a couple of scares, and P&B; are both forced to realize how lucky they are to be together.This story satisfactorily ties up some lingering worries from the previous books while raising new ones in a delightfully heart-felt and often funny way.I've laughed and cried with the Northam family, and I'm anxious to see what's coming next.With each story I find myself falling more and more in love with these characters and the world Brea Brown has built for them.Bravo! </p>

 <p> She's done it again! Mrs.Brown has delivered such an amazing series for her readers! Witty, emotional, likable as well as relatable characters! You can tell the writer puts her whole heart into this series and it truly shows with each word typed! Now as for the cliffhanger, hurry up on book 5, please! </p>

 <p> One of my favorite things about all TSK books is the realistic way in which Ms Brown portrays people of faith. There are no stereotypes, no one overly pious or "good", and no one exceptionally evil or duplicitous. In this latest installment we even get a dose of Brice really losing his cool, although for all the right reasons.I love these stories because the characters are funny and alive. Like so many other fans I find myself thinking of Brice, Peyton and the others as if they were real people, maybe because I've known people like them or see bits of myself in them. And, like with the previous three TSKs, I found myself wishing the story would go on, instead of reaching its inevitable conclusion. After I finished TSK4 I went back to the original so I could savor once again how it all started for Peyton and Brice. I don't know if I'll get through all four before the fifth installment is available but it's a great way to spend the time til then.Thanks, Brea, for keeping the stories coming. As long as you keep writing, I'll keep reading. </p>

 <p> I can't imagine anyone reading this fourth book in The Secret Keeper series without having read the previous three, but this is, in my opinion, Ms. Brown's best book to date (I may correct myself when I get to book five). She stretches and challenges her beloved Brice and Peyton. Are they strong enough for what is in store? Surely their marriage is tested, as are they.The secondary characters are, as always, captivating and multi-faceted, but Pastor and Mrs. Northampton are center-stage in this moving and emotional tale. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Hold on! This is Brea Brown's best yet! </p>

 <p> Let me start by being totally honest here. I am completely in love with one of the main characters in this series. Brice Northam is the epitome of the perfect man (in my eyes anyway). I am so glad I stumbled across The Secret Keeper Series because I honestly feel like I am catching up with old friends each time I pick it up. On top of the fantastic story line the author is a treat too. She engages with her readers via Facebook and loves her characters as much as her readers do. I'm eagerly awaiting the next instalment and luckily I have other Brea Brown books to read in the meantime. Also a footnote&#8230;.. initially I was a bit worried about the storyline being based loosely around the Lutheran Church but fear not it never seems churchy or too religious. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Again I'm eagerly waiting for the next installment! </p>
