 <p> I began reading this book thinking that it was going to be great....sigh. let me say that this book moves too fast. While most erotica novels are just fantasy, this one takes the cake. SMH.... </p>

 <p> I received this box set book in exchange of an honest review.**** I loved this series, I thought it was great to have a foreign lead for a change, the pace was good and it had substance and fluidity and plenty of hot steamy scenes; here is a recap of all four books, there might be some spoilers so do be warned****Chloe is a simple girl who seems to be stuck in a loveless relationship. One day whilst looking for a new job and having a coffee literally runs into a mysterious yet alluring Kaito, the attraction is instant and all of a sudden he's invading her every thought and life. It doesn't take long for Chloe to feel compelled by Kaito's charms and continuos flirting but at the same time she feels bad for betraying her boyfriend Ethan, even though he seems to have drifted apart, so she gives in to one date with Mr, hot and mysterious.The question is will this be really what she's looking for? Will the attraction be enough to give in to temptation and betray her boyfriend? Will one night lead to more? And will her heart survive this unexpected bout of passion?Well then we come to second book and Chloe faces the daunting dilemma of confessing all to Ethan, here we find how desperate one can be of love and be loved, and that sometimes honesty can change our paths and lives forever.We start the third book with Kaito rescuing Chloe in more ways than one, and her in return hoping that she could finally have found the love she has dreamed for so long, but Kaito still holds a secret, something he fears if revealed could scare Chloe away, but he knows if they are meant to be together he must confess,Chloe finally finds out the true identity of Kaito and in this fourth and final book we see her leaving everything behind and moving to Japan with him, even though their relationship just started, their passion and love for each other grows each day, but new revelations will test how Chloe really feels about Kaito and he in turn will make sure to prove to her how serious his feelings really are, will Kaito's love be strong enough to make her stay?? Well you know there is only one way to find out!!! </p>

 <p> Another steamy read from Clarissa Wild.Chloe is unhappy with her loveless relationship with Ethan. When she meets Kaito the sparks fly and he's persistant, but can Chloe go out with him while still with Ethan? And what happens when everything comes to a head and the truth comes out? Who will Chloe end up with and will it lead to her happily ever after?I loved the story line and Chole's willingness to dive in with both arms wide open in to the unknown and just go off her feelings. Kaito was so much fun and those steamy scenes were WOW! Love and Trust led to a whole lot of fun in the bedroom, and on plane, and well.... What are you waiting for go read it and find out! </p>

 <p> I received a copy from the author for my honest review, so here it is. This is a boxed set is a great and steamy story. Chloe meets Kaito when she spills her latte' all over his shirt and she notices that the shirt fits him snugly. Her mind goes to places that makes her blush. When he offers to buy her more latte' and they sit down to talk, they are both attracted to each other. Although Chloe has a boyfriend, she has feelings that her relationship is almost lost. Ethan hasn't touched her in months. When Kaito shows her a little attention, she wants more. He has a secret that he is afraid to share, he doesn't want it to change what she thinks of him. Can she deal with the truth when she finds out what he does for a living? Will she tell him that she is falling in love with him? How does he feel about her? And will they be able to have their HEA? it is a great story and worth the read. Great job Clarissa Wild, looking forward to reading more from her. </p>

 <p> Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest review.I don't like to rehash storylines and plots, so I'll just say what I did and didn't like about these stories. Kaito was portrayed in a very noble and dignified light. I liked how he took time to explain certain Japanese cultural aspects to Chloe, and seemed to genuinely care for her. Although it was a bit hard to believe he wanted to be in a relationship with Chloe the morning after their one-night stand?Chloe, on the other hand, seemed to be a selfish, indecisive twit who aggravated me to no end. She wasn't happy with Ethan (the original boyfriend), so she ends up having a one-night stand. First thing, she didn't want to use protection? Ugh. Then after her walk of shame she has sex with Ethan, without bothering to shower? Skanky much? Although I did like her friend Patricia, at least she kept it real.There were a couple of inconsistencies throughout the series, like her eye color. They're described as one brown, one green, yet later in the same chapter one is blue and the other green. The sex scenes were actually pretty good; but the main thing that annoyed me was that the sex dialogue between Chloe and Kaito while they were getting it in was accurate, but whenever Chloe would describe what was happening, she would refer to her nethers by the medical terms. Nothing can damper steamy reading faster than reading about someone's vulva. And for the love of cheese, please stop referring to Kaito's 3rd leg as "his glory". What the hell, did I suddenly go to church? Enough already!I wish I could have rated higher because the storyline idea was a good one, but for me the overall execution of the stories just didn't do it for me. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> 2.5 Stars....Good premise, story execution needs work </p>

Chloe is drawn to him right away, but knows its wrong because she has a boyfriend Ethan. Kaito entices her with a date but she resists at first knowing though she wants too find out more about this mystery man. She finally gives into temptation after some encouragement from her good friend Patricia.After one night with Kaito she realizes the mistakes she has made and runs back to Ethan. The guilt for what she has done eats her alive and has her running back to the man who turned her world upside down. She still doesn't really know who her mystery man is. She finds out he is a huge Japanese singer. She is swept up into his world and finds she can't help but fall madly in love.I found the story was cute and sassy. The descriptive writing could have been a little more streamlined, but overall it was an enjoyable read! </p>
