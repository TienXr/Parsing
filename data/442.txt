Macias has a unique writing style that puts you in the now of the story so u can experience it as they do there is some spanish mixed in and i love it because it makes me feel a little closer to the characters.THis is my second favorite of the saga boy does Tony have his hands full lol and damn is he hot hot hot.Sebastian Antonio De La Cruz is the familia's architect. He&#8217;s the classic traditional macho Mexicano. He enjoys being single until the primos (his cousins) start falling in love. He starts to think about the chica (girl) of his dreams. </p>

 <p> This is the final book in the De La Cruz series that I have for a review. I have enjoyed reading this series as it is a totally different type of story than I am used to.  The De La Cruz family are a group of self made wealthy people living in So. California who experience nothing but grief from a powerful Mexican Drug Cartel's boss.  This novel is no exception from the rest. The family is drawn into a business deal that starts to go bad when the Cartel tries to play one business associate against the other. Christian De La Cruz has fallen head over heels for the beautiful Cynthia,the spoiled daughter of their business associate,for whom they are in the process of building a mall for. Cynthia is a very persistant woman and does not know what the word NO means.  If you want to know more,you are going to just have to buy the book.  I strongly encourage you to get the whole series and follow the love life of this fictional family.  P T Macias has a very unique style to her writing that I really enjoyed </p>

 <p> The De La Cruz series are endearing reads. The passion is always red hot and the romance between the characters always lead to great stories.I really like reading about the closeness of the family and it's good to have these models in stories to help make us a better daughter, sister, cousin...etc.Tony and Cynthia's story was definitely complicated and I felt for the characters as they were each challenged and experiencing such highs and lows of emotion.Being able to read each of the characters thoughts in real time, help give you a greater insight into what they are each thinking or feeling and is quite unique to Patricia Marcias' writing style.The touch of Spanish helps make the characters more authentic, plus it's fun to pick up!Tony and Cynthia developed a sizzling romance and it was a pleasure to go along for the rideThere are some minor errors but it doesn't detract from the story.I received a free copy but it didn't effect my opinion in this review. </p>

 <p> Another hit in the Series! </p>

 <p> Hot & Spoiled by P.T.Macias is another win for the DeLaCruz family.  Sebastian Antonio has always been my favorite in the series, so sweet and sexy.  I also thoroughly enjoyed visiting the same saga from the Lopez side of the story.  To read from Cynthia's point of view was very refreshing. </p>

 <p> As beta-reader for Patricia Macias, I get to read the De La Cruz Saga before the rest of you. I've got to say that with each new book, I have a new favorite - new favorite book, new favorite primo (cousin), new favorite couple. This one was no exception!Sebastian Antonio De La Cruz (Tony) is my new favorite. He is a strong, stubborn man who knows what he wants and always finds a way to get it! Until he meets Cynthia Lopez, that is. He hates spoiled, whiny mujeres (women). And believe me, Cynthia is about as spoiled as they come! You have to read this story to find out what happens! You won't regret it if you do! </p>

Its a complete rollercoaster of emotions that i never wanted to get off. once i started reading i couldn't put Hot and Spoiled down.Have you ever wanted someone so bad you would do just about anything to be with him well meet  Cynthia a Chica who wants the very hot Chico Sebastian Antonio De La Cruz AKA Tony and she is always popping up in the places that Tony goes to and his work place.Sebastian Antonio De La Cruz (tony) is a well to do man. He is an architect for his family's company and his designs a very in demand. He sees his familia getting married and moving on in their lives and feel their is something missing! But what is missing is a hot chica to keep him on his toes.How they meet well Cynthia goes into the De La Cruz construction company to meet with the architect for her father to go over the plans on the building that Senior Lopez wants to build. Cynthia thought tony was a worker and asks to see the architect in charge and is very demanding and tony think shes completely spoiled.  Tony thinks Cynthia is fast and spoiled so he continues to push her away and deny his feelings for her  and Cynthia just want to be with tony every second but toney just cant seem to make up his mind. Then we have the drama the cartel want the De La Cruz familia to join them but they continually say no an strange incidents happen.Will tony get his act together and get with Cynthia?

 <p> This book was great and had me going from hot to cold in no time at all.  In this book we watch the relationship between Cynthia Lopez and Sebastian Antonio De La Cruz mostly called Tony, who is trying to find the girl of his dreams little does he know she is right in front of him and can set his heart on fire.What I really enjoy about this story is the family aspect, that the siblings all have each others backs especially in times of trouble.  The bonding connection they all have and how they are open when one of the children fall in love.  I especially love the aspect of Family dinners.I am so hooked on this author she does a great job of weaving incredible romance, with the proper amount of steam to get you coming back for more.  Her books are heavily influenced with spanish and it just makes the romances that much steamer, reading phrases in spanish I think really add to the romance and steaminess!Hold on to your hats in this book it is going to be a very steamy ride.  With all the ups and downs Tony and Cynthia do it's a miracle they get it all together on the same page! </p>

 <p> I have read this book by an awesome author. Hot and spoiled is a hot read that I highly recommend. The sex scenes between Sebastian and Cynthia are really hot. Sebastian is a strong man compared to Cynthia who always get whats she wants. But I do wish I can give it more then five stars though. But your gonna have to read the book to see for yourself why. </p>

 <p> Would you dare to fall in love with someone that pushes her way into your heart?How far you would go to make your one and only realizes his feelings for you?Sebastian Antonio De La Cruz is an architect for his family's company and his incredible designs are rapidly winning him some fame and respect in the construction area but there is something that he is missing. His cousins and brother are falling in love and even getting married while he still has not found his soul mate. He wishes for a sweet girl that's not pushy and spoiled like most of the girls he meets at the clubs he goes to with his cousins.Well...what we wish for isn't always what we get or what makes us happy. Tony is the living proof of that statement.Cynthia is demanding, spoiled and a little annoying from time to time bus she is actually a very sweet girl that would do anything for her loves ones. She is passionate and isn't afraid to show it to the world. When she met Tony she knew he was hers and only hers.Love at first sight does exist. He is her soul mate and now that she found him she just needs to make him realize they are meant to be.Why is he so stubborn and doesn't want to give them a chance?Why is she so spoiled and doesn't want to realize that the passion they feel is just that?Cynthia moves to fast while Tony is confused about his feelings. He isn't ready for a serious relationship and much less with a pushy and spoiled girl. She is everything he ever wanted and hated at the same time.Welcome to a world full of drama, comedy and romance.If you though you knew everything both the Mexican American world think again. </p>
