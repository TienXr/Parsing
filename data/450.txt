 <p> I really liked this book. At first I was kinda confused as to where the story was going, but I kept on reading and of course I ended up enjoying this midnight novella! Damaya know she scared me! I just knew that her promiscuous ways was going to get her into some trouble. Poor thing she was so damage by her childhood that she used casual sex to mask all that pain. Her mother really did a number on her. Madison has some issues as well, and those little things that she had going on in her mind was interfering with her wifely duties. She finally drove her husband, Borick, over the edge. He said enough was enough and he left. For the most part Borick was a good guy, but that dang Chat Line got him. I wonder will he be able to spring back, and make things right with Madison? It may be over for those two. Will Damaya straighten up and fly right, or will her undiscriminating habits, send her down a deadly road where there is no turning back. I guess I will have to see in part two. I rated this book 4 stars, because it started out a little slow, and there were a few editing issues. Nothing a good editor couldn't fix. If you looking for a quick short and sweet story, with a twist, then I'd recommend it. Nice job, Chocolate Boss Chick! </p>

 <p> A decent start and probably the potential for a great story line,  however it ends before a real plot develops. In all fairness, it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. I would have to wait for part 2 to really determine this book's worth. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Way too short </p>

 <p> I never thought that someone would write a book similar to real life. I'm shocked that Brior would cheat on his wife, like wtf. </p>

 <p> Just when it got good,it ended. Madison should have known that what she won't do the next one will. Not condoning what Bori did, but I understand. </p>

 <p> I know it said it was a novella but hell I think I only read 5-7 pages before it was over. I see there are 3 parts to this story, which that  tends to be a turn off for me. There is no need to sell such short stories when you could have made it into ONE book!I really don't have much to judge off on to say whether I like the story or not because it was that short! </p>

 <p> Way too short </p>
