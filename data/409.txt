 <p> True to the nature of cats this kitten loves sleep and will not change his mind for anyone. The little girl is given this cat for a birthday present and shares with us what it is like having it. I like the easy story that goes with the pictures. </p>

 <p> Einstein seems to be like most cats, asleep. It's a book that gives Einstein so many scenarios, and the love of a simple cat for his owner, shines through. (Cats will be pleased.)  Clever, and gently illustrated; it doesn't always make it with the rhyming pattern, I found. But kids will warm to this book and like the funny nature of it. Another books which shows the silly side of life too isIf You Find A Monkey - A Rhyming Book for Children (Rhyming for Children)It's full of different rhyming sequences and things that happen, often to animals. Fun books, lots of variety. </p>

 <p> Where did you find this boneless kitten?  He is so sweet.  The drawings in this book are yummy.  Any cat lover will be smitten.  The story is flowing, with only an few trips in meter or awkward passages to muddle the tongue.  The text should drawl and be as lazy as Einstein...but it ripples like a brook babbling hurridly away.  IMHO  In my humble opinion. </p>

 <p> This book gives a child's eye view of what a little lazy kitty can see in his or her enviornment.  The pictures would entice a child to want to read this book. Thank you for making it so enjoyable for me, and I will certainly use it for my students this summer when I do story hour with my students. </p>

 <p> A Child's Review of Einstein the Lazy Kitty </p>


<h2> review.date </h2>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The story of Einstein the Lazy Kitty is told in rhymes. The text alternates with pictures so it is large enough for even very young children to read. The story is basically about a little girl named Jessie who gets a cat for her birthday. When she tries to get Einstein to go outside to play he refuses and says: "No, I don't think so." This book is actually sort of funny and will amuse young readers. The book is based on the author's cat who likes to sleep a lot. There are a few pictures of the real cat at the end. The point of the story seems to be that we should accept animals as they are. However I have a feeling that for Jessie's next birthday she will ask for a puppy.~The Rebecca Review </p>

 <p> My son and I loved this. Very sweet. I'd like to see more books with Einstein. I expected him to wake up at night and drive her crazy though! Thats what my cat would have done. </p>

 <p> Although this book was funny, my son thought it was too short.  He wanted more funny stories about this kitty since he has 4 very lazy kitties who sleep a lot.  He liked the pictures a lot. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Good book </p>
