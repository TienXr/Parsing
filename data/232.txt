 <p> Invader Zim The Complete Invasion is a must have for Zim fanatics. Not only does it contain every episode of the original series, it also has interesting commentaries from the creators and voice actors. The manufacturers of this DVD collection also had a sense of humor when they decided to include "Irken" subtitles for entertainment. I recommend this collection for true Zim fans and anyone who enjoys a slightly macabre sense of humor. </p>

 <p> Excellent Collection for Invader Zim fans. </p>

 <p> If you're a real Zim fan in the US or Latin America, you won't be disappointed by this!!! This is a great deal! The whole series in one single box. It's better to buy this box than buying each volume individually.This cartoon has become a cult due to one single reason: this cartoon is something really special and there is no other cartoon like this anymore! If you want to laugh out loud, don't miss this!If you haven't seen the show yet, where have you been? Don't miss this, you won't regret it! </p>

 <p> This  is, I think, the single greatest animated series I have ever witnessed.  I do not even know how to describe the insanity that is ZIM.  I guess the best way is animated Python.  You look like you need waffles!  I love this show!!  It's so Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeevil!!!!! </p>

 <p> I love this cartoon.  It is well written with great characters (Grr is my favorite), any one that has seen this will know why.  With the plot of the cartoon being an alien taking over the world and a lot of violence I wouldn't let my children watch until they are at least 10 but I still enjoy it very much. </p>

 <p> This is no doubt the crown jewel of animation.  I absolutely love this show and Nickelodeon sucks for not continuing the series.  These cartoons are timeless and I can watch them over and over and they still make me laugh.  Like many of Nick's toons, there are a lot of jokes that adults will find funny, and of course Gir is just hilarious and can make anyone laugh.  As far as the DVD set, this is the complete set with all 6 discs of the series at a great price.  You can buy the house box separately which comes with the special features disc not available on its own.  It has some OK stuff but only necessary if you are a hardcore fan.  This 6 disc set is really all you need, it's awesome and contains the entire series.  Enjoy, filthy humans! </p>

 <p> invader zim has to be one of my favourite shows. it's one of those things that has an almost cultish effect on people, well the people who get into it anyways. there are so many awesome quotes in this show... like classic, change you're life-funny quotes. my and my brother sometimes have zim quote battles and see who can come up with the most quotes. and we say them to each other in everyday conversation, or even if we aren't talking, a quote from zim will break the silence. it's like this when i find other people into zim too. when i find out they love it too i'll say a quote and they'll say one back to me... it's like finding a long lost sibling, i love it.the show itself seems like it's going to be slow-paced when you start watching it, and i guess it can be a bit. it also has a kind of dark atmosphere, so it is to be watched in moderation. i wouldn't recommend watching a whole season in one go unless you're in the mood for it. if you watch too much at once the atmosphere will get to you a bit and the pacing can be depressing, which is an odd contrast to the comedic aspect of the show.the characters are amazing. zim is set up as an idiot, an outcast, and really bad at what he was meant to do, but i don't think he is the failure we would think he is. zim reminds me of how geniuses are thought to be crazy be those around them and only later are they appreciated. zim is not a genius, but i do think that he's under estimated by everyone on the show. he is successful if some of what he sets out to do, but he's like the coyote from the roadrunner show, he's just got bad luck. dib is most relatable because he is the second main character of the show and we get to see his personality the most of all the characters. even though zim is the main character we don't really relate to him and get inside his head but almost see him through the eyes of someone else. in the shows focusing on dib, maybe because he complains out loud a lot or because he's always searching for something, but it feels more like we are going on the adventure with dib rather than watching from a distance like with zim. dib is also unappreciated by the other characters, but like zim he's actually really smart and not crazy at all, though with dib it's easier to see this than with zim because people think dib is crazy for thinking zim is an alien, and we know that zim is an alien, so we're united by the truth i guess. gaz is a great character and i wish there were more episodes focused on her. she's really irritable, but she's not like any other person on the show in that she has this inner strength, which sets her apart as the odd one out. an example of this would be the episode where pustulio was hypnotizing everyone, but it didn't get gaz because she didn't give it the time of day. and she is shown in this way in a lot of episodes. i guess the fact that the show's focus isn't really on her, even though she is one of the main characters is almost an example of her character. her reluctance to engage in anything makes her a really interesting, and though we'd like to see more of her, maybe the fact that we can't is evidence of her personality. and of course there's gir... little need be said of gir other than the fact that gir is awesome. if there was no gir the show wouldn't be what it is and a lot of the comedy is because of gir, not all, but a lot. unlike the other characters, it seems gir's only purpose is for comedic effect. gir lightens the dark atmosphere of the show.invader zim is like metal (the music) in that it has a core of die hard fans, but the rest of the world kind of does really know about it. it's a hugely funny show. the comedy is kind of dry and satirical, and slightly over the top and... awesome. just awesome. i recommend it. </p>

 <p> Invader Zim-Complete InvasionThis is a wonderful 6-disk set with every single Invader Zim Episode on it. This set includesInvader ZIM - Doom Doom Doom (Vol. 1),Invader ZIM - Progressive Stupidity (Vol. 2), andInvader ZIM - Horrible Holiday Cheer (Vol. 3). That's 27 episodes in all. This is an amazing off considering the price of these DVDs if bought separately.Invader Zim is a dark, disturbing cartoon that looks like someone made it that was insane (but in a good way). The basis of the story is that an alien, Zim, from planet Irk is sent to a mysterious planet on what he thinks is a mission to conquer it. His leaders, The Almighty Tallest, only sent him away to be rid of him for a while. Zim and his robot servant, GIR, just so happen to land on Earth. Sadly, Zim is unequipped to handle the challenges that await him on Earth. To make matters worse for Zim, a child with a huge head named Dib sets out to stop Zim at all costs.All the episodes are full of laughs and ridiculous screaming. GIR is the funniest character due to his complete randomness and idiotic nature. Some episodes are more based on Dib or Gaz, Dib's Sister, than on Zim, but they are still very well done.My only complaint with the series is that the episode they used to close out the series, The Most Horrible X-mas Ever, was completely stupid. It introduced a new character named Mini-Moose for no reason at all. The episode itself isn't funny at all compared to other episodes in this box set. Invader Zim went out with a whimper and no closure whatsoever.If you are into wacky cartoons or like Invader Zim already, you owe it to yourself to pick this up. </p>

 <p> The story of a short teen-middle aged mentally unstable alien vs a 7-12 year old mentally unstable human nerd.This is the best thing I've seen on Nickelodeon since the early 90s ended. It's also the show that made me stop caring about Nickelodeon; Not sure what they were thinking, having the creator of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac do a children's show. They told Jhonen they wanted something edgy for teens, then they put it in inappropriate time slots, refused to sell it to MTV at his request, & ultimately cancelled it; clearly Nick only cares about money & nothing else. God, I just want to buy the rights to this show just so I can give it back to it's creator.Naturally, Jhonen tried to get as much s*** past the censors as he cold (as Adventure Time does today). Zim will occasionally try to outright kill Dib, Gaz is a serial killer in the making, & many characters will either die offscrene or have near-death experiences. Jhonen says most of the episodes are self-contained with no continuity, so Zim & Dib are probably shown seconds before death at the end of several episodes.While very toned down from his usual bag of grizzly horrors, his mark is all over this thing; everyone wears knee-high boots, triangular body shapes, screaming, screaming in bathrooms, bulging eyes, goth/punk-like fashion, cartoon violence, neglectful parents, moose, easter eggs in the backgrounds, background characters dying in horrible ways, everyone has ADHD, grungy crapsack world, character filibusters, comedic sociopathy, socially awkward unpopular protagonist, etc.You will occasionally see characters in the background holding JTHM comics, suggesting that it's a comic in that world, yet Ms. Bitters, Sanguine, Pepito, & Filler Bunny, & Mystic Hill occur in both series. Perhaps Zim takes place in the future. Sadly, no sightings of Nny, Anne, Devi, Squee, Senior Diablo, or Tes yet.You may also enjoy: Sam & Max (games, book, cartoon), Jhonen's other stuff, Stain Boy, Lenore, Coraline, Ren & Stimpy, Aeon Flux, Liquid Television, The Maxx, Duckman, Cartoon Sushi, Cow & Chicken, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Rocko's Modern Life, American McGee's Alice, American McGee's Grim, A Series of Unfortunate Events (books). </p>

 <p> Some people have complained that this DVD set is not a good value for the money.  I would like to advise these reviewers to stop smoking crack.My justification:  this DVD set contains 27 episodes, about 23 minutes long apiece.  That's over 10 hours of top-notch content for sixteen bucks (not counting commentary and special features).  A typical movie is two hours for the same price, if you're lucky.In "Invader Zim"'s case, the value comes in at pennies per laugh.This DVD set is money all the way; it's the entire "Invader Zim" series in a single package, and it's extremely well done.  The picture is great, the sound is great, and (if you're into this sort of thing) there's a wealth of commentary and extras.  It's a near-perfect production.  If you like "Invader Zim", you should pick up this box set forthwith; anything less would be corporal punishment.(Plus, if you buy the "complete invasion" 3-volume set, you are getting the "uncut" Christmas episode, unlike the earlier versions of the DVDs that were sold individually, volume-by-volume.)That said, "Invader Zim" isn't for everyone.  If you've never seen it before, download an episode via Amazon or iTunes and give it a gander.  It's weird, dark and terrific, with layers of details that come out with repeated viewings.It's really hard to go wrong by buying this box set.  It especially makes a great gift; at this price, you can buy box sets all around. </p>

 <p> Very simply one of the best cartoons of all time. I caught a few episodes of this show while it was on the air and was addicted right away. Unfortunately  they took the show away and I cried for a few years. Luckily now I found the complete series here for only $15.99 how insane is that!There are only 2 things, only 2! that I was slightly irritated at and they are not a big deal at all.1. When you pick an episode to watch and it ends it automatically goes on to the next one. Just used to shows defaulting to the episode menu.2. The "box" that holds the 3 dvd set is about as strong as kids construction paper again, used to having my sets in actual boxes.Like I said though these are just minor irritants and very easy to over look as this is a very great show and such a bargain. I only wanted to post them so others had a heads up and don't get that weird smirked look on their face when they open the box up.Anyhow buy this set because "It's not stupid it's advanced!!"****Overly protective and crazy parents, be forewarned this cartoon does have some excessive cartoon violence and depicts some odd sceans nothing that a normal person would think twice about but this message is for you, the person who won't let his 15 year old kid go to a pg-13 movie, and you the person who thinks movies like 'The Goonies' (or any other 'kids' movie made in the 80's) are too graphic for kids.... You have been warned you loonies!**** </p>

 <p> I purchased this at Christmas-time at the request of my 10 & 11 year-old boys and what fun it has been to watch them watch it.  My 4 year-old daughter has also been sucked in to the Invader Zim vortex and wants to be GIR for halloween this year.  I cannot believe this series didn't run longer than it did - maybe it was a bit ahead of its time.  There are certain aspects of the storylines & animation that hearken me back to when Ren & Stimpy was new and fresh, but not in any sort of rip-off way that so many animated series are guilty of.  The voice of Zim, performed by Richard Horvitz (Billy's voice on The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy) makes me laugh, no matter what the lines are.  Hilarious!!  It also features other great voice acting by Kevin McDonald (Pleakley on Lilo & Stitch) & Rodger Bumpass (Squidward on Spongebob Squarepants), as well as many guest voices. The stories are funny and the animation is hilarious, being both rebellious & family-friendly at the same time.  I still cannot believe that this 6 DVD set is as cheap as it is.  There isn't a better value for a DVD series out there!! Buy it today and you will be laughing tomorrow!! </p>

 <p> This is crazy yet so funny. Zim's little robot companion is so funny you can't wait to see what he is doing. Its like watching a little kid asking goofy questions. Well you can't go wrong with the box set cost and you get plenty of entertainment. </p>
