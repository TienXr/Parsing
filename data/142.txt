 <p> The product looks great, and is the perfect length. Basically, everything about this adapter is awesome, except the fact that it developed a short in the wires in less than a week. I *really* don't want to have to use molex adapters, so I'm hoping that A) I just got a manufacturer defect and B) the seller will offer to replace it.Update: Amazon and Circotech both contacted me to replace the item. The replacement item works well, so I'm assuming the first one was a fluke. Circotech contacted me offering to replace the item, then I replied to them and never received a response back.Bottom line: Cable works as intended, Amazon was great, seller (Circotech) was courteous but didn't follow through. Rating increased from 1 star to 4. </p>

 <p> I needed extra connectors to add extra PC fan connections to install extra internal fans. I had no more available connections on my motherboard. This gave me what I needed to add those fans. </p>

 <p> There was a manufacturer defect. There were missing pins on most of the splits. Sleeving and heatshrink are nice but if the product is not working or tested before being shipped, no use to me.MOVE ALONG. </p>

 <p> It's just a wire splitter.  Why not split four ways instead of two for the same price? This works great. </p>

 <p> Waiting for a month for this to arrive to my country in south america, only to find it was broken. There was some bad wiring on one of the ends, black and red wires were misplaced. Of course it's not a difficult fix, but the product should work out of the box as expected. Also, I checked up wiring where all the wires are glued together, and some of them were so poorly put together that they lost contact right away. Now I need to fix and check all of the wire connections with a solder. In the end, I'll use the 3-pin female and males and make my own splitter. Not recommended. </p>

 <p> This connector works well.  I would not feed multiple fans from a motherboard connections with this, would draw too much power, and probably confuse the motherboards RPM sensor.  But if you just want to attach multiple fans without any speed control this is the thing to use.  Recommended. </p>

 <p> Works well </p>

 <p> easy to use convenient to use for any application, no problems in attaching but I will say that if you use this on multiple fans make sure they are the same size otherwise the smaller fans will spin faster. </p>

 <p> Fan splitters are essential when you get more than 3 or 4 fans in a chassis.  This one works well, and I do not need variable speed fans in this application </p>

 <p> This cables are VERY good for my motherboard, I can only connect 2 fans.. Bought this cable and now i have 5 fans without any problem.The only CON, is when I put a limiter to reduce all the fans from 12v to 5v, the cable don't have enough power and the fans doesn't turn on. But if you conect the 5v limiter to the fan on the other side, it works great!Este cable es muy bueno para mi placa madre, solo puedo conectarle 2 ventiladores.. Compre este cable y ahora conecto 5 ventiladores sin ningun problema.La unica contra, es cuando pongo un limitador de 12v a 5v, el cable no pasa suficiente energia y los ventiladores no prenden. But si conecto el limitador de 5v al ventilador en el otro extremo, funciona perfectamente. </p>

 <p> Purchased 2 of these to hook up into my Corsair 900d case. They are straight forward, turns 1 3 pin connection into 4. The downside, ordering 2, completely wiring your system, to find out that one of them is a dud. Tested it on 2 different power connections (1 mobo header and a 3 pin to molex) and absolutely no power.1 out of 2 cables working is better that none, nevertheless it's a cable and there's not much to it for it to work. I'm going to send this back and probably buy a more reputable branded cable.EDIT **3-3-2014I tried contacting the seller twice about one of the cables not working, and of course never got a reply. I ended up cutting into the heatshrink, to find out the wires they used to solder together were very thin and ripped apart. I ended up having to strip the wire down and solder it again but it does work.I recommend getting the Phobya PWM splitter, not only is it manufactured better it also allows you to have PWM control of all the fans. </p>

 <p> Does exactly what it was designed to do.I had one issue though, and this might have been a deal-breaker for someone else. When my splitter came, it was non-functional. I used a multimeter to measure voltage on the female connectors, and there was none. I cut the sheathing off and found that the black cable had broken off at a solder point. I simply resoldered it and replaced the shrink wrap. It has been working perfect since.I don't expect these to all have this issue, so I am not going to mark it down. </p>
