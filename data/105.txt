 <p> This was a great replacement for our charger.  We didn't know if the battery wasn't working or the charger, so we got a new charger first.  This charger worked great and fit well for our pavilion. </p>

 <p> This was an HP brand at non-HP prices. It powers the laptop as expected. We will not know until it has been used a while of it truly was a good value but I do not expect any issues. </p>

 <p> I have a HP G60 model computer from 2009. Still runs great and works perfectly for a computer that is going on 5 years old at least. For some reason HP can make a damn charger. This is the 3rd replacement I have bought since the other two have shorted out or wires became exposed. This one has done me well and I will buy another one if the one I have takes a dump on me. </p>

 <p> Perfect </p>

 <p> I bought this charger to replace one my daughter lost.  It works great with two HP G series laptops we have.  Definately a good pick up.  I would not hesitate to buy another of these chargers should another go missing. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I bought this as a 2 nd charger to use when I travel. I used it twice. So far so good.UpdateI gave it 3 stars because it fit and worked twice . This was downgraded from my earlier rating.It is May 12, 2013. The charger no longer works and is out of the Amazon return window. This was only the third use. It failed to work on the third.I tried to contact Texasdiscountelectronics. If they respond and remedy the situation, I will adjust the rating accordingly. </p>

 <p> Charger works flawlessly! I over used it by going back & forth between my two laptops and I caused it to overheat I guess but I simply contacted them and they got me with a new charger. Thanks! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I have bought many adapters just like this one but the difference of this adapter and the other ones I have bought is quality. This one is more like the original that came with my computer. Don't let the picture fool you though, it is not an official HP adapter but it is just as good if not better. It has been 6 months since receiving this adapter and it is still perfect. I am very happy with this adapter and plan to buy another one to have an extra. </p>

<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> ORIGINAL CHARGER, ADAPTER FOR G72, HP LAPTOP </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is the original HP adapter that came in the box with my HP, g72 laptop. I tried to get others that claimed they would fit to save $$$. But they did not work, this has the three prong ,not two prong that fits my g72  HP laptop. It is a great buy and prime shipping. Much better price than ordering it from HP. I will say it again. It is the original adapter and has HP on the adapter. It looks EXACTLY the same as the one that shipped with the new laptop. </p>

 <p> My laptop all of a sudden stopped charging, I wasnt sure if it was my computer or if my charger was just old. I crossed my fingers and bought this charger with Amazon and i'm really happy to say it IS compatible with my HP G60 Laptop. It instantly charged it and I am up and running again! </p>

 <p> Works fine, does the job.  Can't beat the price for an actual HP brand charger.  If you need a charger for an older model HP why buy an odd brand after-market charger? </p>

 <p> Thanks for this charger, it save me from boredoom. The only thing about this product is that it kind of fragile. I noticed that its pilling, yes pilling at one end without dropping anything on it. You can prevent that based on how you fold it and stretch it. </p>

 <p> Works as advertised! </p>

 <p> I ordered this as a replacement for my HPG60 as described it is a HP charger and it does work for the G60 however when i pluged it in my computer informed me that the capacitor for this charger is smaller than the origional and would not charge at optimal performance. It does charge it, just at a slower rate and when i put my computer on hi perfomance it gets very hot but as long as it works ill take it over the $60 one. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Good price for replacement charger </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I bought this for my parents HP laptop back in the springtime, March or April, after being repaired for charging issues. They've left their laptop with the cord attached in the carrying bag, which was a bad idea. After browsing other websites, for a similar charging unit for many $$$ more, this was the best price and came promptly. Haven't had any issues with mine, yet, but I know where to get one in case it does. </p>
