 <p> Interesting take on children peaking in their lives at age 12 and never quite recovering. A little too much of Julie Stevens but hey, she directed it. </p>

 <p> Saw this on cable in late 2007.  Great documentary look at showbiz and its effects on children, rising child stars, and STAGE MOTHERS.  There were some interesting stories about off-stage affairs between some of the parents who traveled with the children on tour.I love showbiz behind-the-scenes peeks, and this one is a winner. </p>

 <p> First of all, I disliked everything about Annie.  The tedious music, the hideous belting, the maudlin storyline.  But I enjoy behind the scenes shows and got this so I could say to myself, "HAH! Annie is not only stupid and pointless, it ruined LIVES!! Bwahh hahahahah!"Well, not really.It is troubling to see some of the women in their 30s and 40s still living in the past, but whose fault is that? As one behind the scene-er said, "Well, of course they were gonna be unemployed.  This is a show with 8 children in it. There aren't any shows with 8 fifteen year olds."But they had been led to believe, at least it seems, that being in Annie was only the beginning! They'd all be STARS! And if they are befuddled now, they must have been even more so in the '80s, when Danielle Brisbois and Molly Ringwald were household names.The girls were also encouraged to think that they were great only because they were in this show. So when it was over, most of them--at least the ones that showed up for the interview, were completely without direction.The editing was pure genius.  Some of the women are diplomatic in the extreme, carefully telling painful stories without identifying who they are about.  Then, the next interview shows EXACTLY who the embarrassing story is about, again without naming names.It's no surprise that no long-term singing careers resulted from Annie, given the shouting that passed for music.  The biggest star seems to be Sarah Jessica Parker, who has certainly changed her singing style and is now known mostly as an actor, anyway.  She has fond memories of the show, where most of the others seem to have mixed feelings. Many seem to have done it only for their mothers, which is sad.But some of the women have come to terms with this most exciting time in their lives. One, a teacher, says that she was surprised when someone told her she had a successful career, and that's when she realized that her teaching DID make her a success.The producer is a former Annie, which gives this documentary a lovely, bittersweet personal touch.All in all, great storytelling, an insightful and enjoyable show. </p>

 <p> I suppose when all is said and done, it does what it says on the cover. However, I think I was expecting maybe a bit more. Maybe some more footage from the past productions, more gossip from backstage, more interviews with other adult cast members to get their opinions on the children and their behaviour, etc. It's still a very interesting piece of theatre history and the way that something like this can affect different children in different ways - human nature, I suppose. Just lacks that certain something </p>

 <p> For anyone who has ever wondered "What happened to that child star" here is the answer for at least one play. I loved the way the film did not really make judgements and that there was a balance in the memories (good and bad) from prior castmembers. My one request would have been, more of behind the scenes of the play itself. If you take a look at the video, be sure to check out the extras as there are some quite enjoyable additions in this area. I remember seeing Annie when it first came out and this brought back some great memories! </p>

 <p> Loved the movie, but I wanted to see more of the play.. </p>

 <p> As a cast member of the second and fourth national tours of ANNIE I remember some of the ladies interviewed in this film when they were young actresses. It was great seeing them again "all grown up". However, I don't remember things the way they do. Mothers having affairs; drugs running rampant; near-naked dancers warming-up backstage? Where was I when all this was happening? But I really enjoyed this look back at a wonderful time in my life and marvel at other people's points of view. </p>

 <p> Considering Annie is one of my all time favorites this was very interesting to see a different perspective and finally get to see who all has played the adorable Annie. </p>

 <p> Life After Tomorrow is a documentary about what happens in life after your dreams come true. The film reunites cast members who played orphans in the Broadway production of Annie. Via interviews with high-profile "annies" like Sarah Jessica Parker, viewers get a glimpse of life inside the dream-nights at Studio 54 when you're ten, life on the road with tutors who got high, stage mothers who had affairs with stage fathers and subsequent abortions, and worst of all, growth spurts which predicated your removal from the show. As one cast member in the film remarks, "the younger ones are coming to take your place and you're 12."This isn't a US Weekly type of documentary. There are no child star "smash-ups" here-no stories of "annies" robbing liquor marts for drug money because they weren't able to readjust to life after stardom. The tragedy here is subtle and understated. Many of these women admit to being forced off stage and continuing life with the nagging hope in their heart that they would get back to Broadway. Life happens to these actresses-they become financial planners, mothers and annoying stage mothers, but some of them are obviously stuck somewhere else-not in tomorrow, but yesterday-when they were singing and dancing in Annie. Some of them haven't self-actualized which is unpleasant to see in someone who is turning 40. Others have adjusted OK. It's interesting, but it's also a hard-knock life when you peak at 10. </p>

 <p> LIFE AFTER TOMORROW is a documentary about women who were in either the Broadway show or a touring company of the Broadway musical ANNIE as children.  Some were actual "Annies" and others played one of the seven orphan girls. The women reveal some "shocking" behind the scenes secrets about pushy stage mothers, jealous adult cast members, neglectful inept tutors and some other sort of sordid details of stage life that we kind of take for granted happen in professional theater productions. Most of the women loved being part of ANNIE and the biggest regret of many is that no other experience has really lived up to it.  Maybe some counseling when they left the show to return to normal life would have been beneficial but it is tough to work up too much sympathy for these women who seemingly benefited from a great gig. </p>
