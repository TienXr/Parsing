 <p> Very nice calendar with big squares for writing notes and things.  The pictures are also very pretty.  I was very pleased. </p>

 <p> I've been buying the "Out on the Porch" calendar for a couple of years.  The pictures are lovely and as a calendar, it does the job.  The reason for the 3 stars is the manufacturers are calling the work in.  Several of the shots from this year's calendar are almost identical to last year's pictures.  Different locations, but staged almost exactly the same--same lighting, same kinds of chairs--almost exactly the same porch!!  Also the porches used to be lovely--almost art works in themselves.  This year, they're snap shots of the neighbor's porch.  They can do better because they have done better in the past. </p>

 <p> Nice calendar, but... </p>

 <p> I wouldn't buy this product unless you don't mind that it's missing January. Oh well only three weeks to go so I can use it. </p>

 <p> Missing a month. Unbelievable! </p>

 <p> I like this calendar fine, but I wanted each of the photos to be large and clear, like the one on the cover. There are more words than I wanted on the pictures. </p>

 <p> I have purchased this particular calendar for over five years consecutively.  I love it!  Each year the pictures show very nice setting of what the ideal front porch would look like.  It gives me pleasure to view the front porch pictures and to dream that maybe one of these pictures just might be my own front porch some day! </p>

 <p> Great Calendar </p>

 <p> I've use this calendar every year and enjoy the different porch scenes. Over the years some of the porches look quite similar but still has a fresh look. For the first time last year I was late in placing my order and was never able to get one to use for 2012. Amazon get looking for one several months into the new year but finally had to give up. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Order the calendar before the new year! </p>

 <p> The quality of this calendar is top notch. However, I was disappointed at some of the pictures, for instance a beach scene in January - just doesn't work for us in the mid-atlantic region. While I wouldn't expect to see us sitting on the front porch in a snow scene, I would have hoped for a sun porch at least. Several other months are a disappointment, too. </p>

 <p> I love the pictures on all the Out on the Porch calendars.  This one doesn't disappoint. They give me a mini vacation each time I look at them. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Peaceful views </p>

 <p> It's a nice enough calendar, but I just feel like they missed the boat on some of the pictures they've matched with the winter months. Sorry, but when it's January, I want to see snow-capped mountains, not an island view. This won't be a repeat purchase for me. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> For Me, No Repeat Purchase </p>
