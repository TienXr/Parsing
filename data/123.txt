 <p> Easy to assemble and break down. I only wish it came with a stand. Still, quite good for the price. </p>

 <p> Small easy set up and break down great for in and outdoor perfect for the cowboy 150s strobes [...] cover photo used this box and a cowboy 150 </p>

 <p> Received one as a gift.  The Octogon SB, does provide for a nice soft light without the spill of a shoot through umbrella.  As other have mentioned, there is limited movement (i.e it is difficult to angle at all), but for standard portraits, it works well. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Good deal for soft light </p>

 <p> Was looking for something to create some soft light and this fit the bill nicely.. It's def not a Wescott.. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Very good for the price </p>

 <p> Works great but hard to tilt downwards because the stand is actually inside.  At most, you can only have it horizontal. </p>

 <p> I like the soft box except you cannot tilt them back and forth because they are completely covered, other than that they work! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Nice soft box </p>

 <p> Only thing I can ask for is instructions. Please provide those. It's confusing. Other than that i love this thing. </p>

 <p> Just got this and put an sb800 camera strobe in it, set to 1/4 power.  At 400 ISO I got a reading of F5.6 at about six feet indoors.  I expect to get about F4 outdoors, F5.6 at 800 ISO...that's with a camera strobe only.... I then used the softbox for an outdoors family portrait last weekend and the results were great.  I used a Lumedyne portable strobe and everything fit nicely inside the box.  It's pretty well made considering the price.  I'm amazed that I can get this quality for $20.00.  I've paid over $100 for Wescott brand umbrella-mount boxes that aren't as nicely shaped. </p>

 <p> Great for the price </p>

 <p> I have used this for several shoots.  It's compact and sets up in a decent amount of time.  If you want faster setup, you pay exponentially more so it's up to your pocket book if something faster is required.  Results are great: soft light on your subject and exactly what you expect if you use it right. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Great results, a bit of a pain to set up, but well-worth the money. </p>

 <p> This Off Camera Photography Photo Studio Umbrella is really good, I might get more of this.  The only bad thing I found is the zipper won't let the umbrella face down but I think that is not an issue because I can ensamble differnet and problem solve ;-) </p>

 <p> I've taken this to several shoots and it's holding strong. My only gripe is the bag it comes in. Once broken down, the bag seems a bit small for both the umbrella and the white material. Other than that it's a winner </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Great softbox </p>

 <p> Does a nice job with diffusing light. Good size for 3/4 length shots. Unfortunately it does not swivel so you won't be able to place it above your subject and angle down. Also, the ribs are not very strong. I dropped it and two of the ribs bent. I was able to bend them back into place and all is good now. It obviously is not high-end but if you take care of it (and find a way to angle it) it does just as good a job as the high-end softboxes. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Photos look nice and soft </p>

 <p> Nice Octogon Softbox, I paid less than $40 bucks so I got what I expected. I use it when Im out in the field and it does what I need it to do. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> OK I guess </p>
