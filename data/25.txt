 <p> i've only used the remote for a short time. the source button changes the source. the att button mutes the sound on dvd and ipod. volume buttons work with everything. the menu and top menu work very well with dvd menus, but not with ipod music. the subtitle button brings you to subtitle menu on dvd. i didn't have a dvd that has different camera angle's, but looks like it may work. i couldn't get the folder and disc buttons to work with anything. audio menu works, can change radio stations, go to prev or next on ipod songs. didn't get auto play, and book mark buttons to work. direct button turn the screen to a blank grid screen. the rewind, play/pause, and fast forward buttons work great on dvd's, not ipod. prev and next chapter buttons work great on dvd, not ipod. stop button stops dvd. back button for me didn't work. band changed fm to am. disp button changed screen to blank screen. ent button didn't work for me. the number buttons work to change radio stations you have set on your unit well. clear button didn't work for me. this does pretty much everything i want it to and is suppose to do. i only took one star off because the menu button didn't control my ipod music menu's, but worked very with dvd. also when the 7in sreen is tucked in it still works to control and change radio stations, prev and next songs and so forth. so far a few buttons i haven't gotten to work with my unit, but i don't regret buying it. hope this helps. </p>

 <p> Attention iPOD owners: This remote control only works for changing songs and volume control, it does not work to change/view playlist or anything else within the iPOD.  That is why I didn't rate it with 5 stars.For the rest, you can be sure it will do what it is supposed to do, change stations (radio) and full control on DVD movies. </p>

 <p> A bit bulky but does the job.  It would be nice if they made it a bit smaller so that it would be more practical, particularly when using in the car. </p>

 <p> I bought this remote for a Pioneer AV4000 I beleive anyway the radio is a touchscreen and I put in my wifes truck and I didn't want to mess it up so I bought this remote and it works great. There was only two problems with that I didn't like. 1)It has 3 settings on the side of it for different devices (didn't know that at first)and I hit the switch and my wife said it stopped working. Once I realized what happened I fixed it and showed her now there is no problem. 2)I like to adjust the EQ on the unit but the remote will not go to that feature so I do it manually. Besides that I love it cause this will extend the life of the radion cause I don't need to touch it as much </p>

 <p> Works great with my AvicD3 a bit big but slim, controls radio great. When it comes to CD's I thought I could punch in the actual number on the remote for a certain track cause visualy it leads you to beleive that you can, having a 10 button for selecting double digit tracks on the remote. Well you can't. It does however control my DVD player great! It also does not control any of the MAIN menus or the navigation menus including the bluetooth menu. BUT for the price very satisfied would purchase again! </p>

 <p> I purchased this about a year ago. Most of the time it works great, however I do have problems with it communicating with my Pioneer head unit. I'm really not sure why, it just seems to have a bad connection every once in a while for some odd reason. Other than that, and the fact that it is a bit bulky, it's a descent product. </p>

 <p> Bought this for my AVH-P5700DVD unit. Works as described and quite useful. It would have been cool had there been another remote out there that only had the major buttons (volume, menu ctrl, etc) and because I use the AV input 90% of the time I only use the volume buttons (which is the main reason for buying). But for a fully functional remote its great. 4 stars. </p>

 <p> I didn't need this to operate the 3100dvd, but wanted it to use on trips (as the co-pilot) to change tracks on CDs and to adjust volume level. Works great for those duties, as well as mute function for when we answer the cellphone. Also works well for controlling DVD watching needs. These are found cheaply online, only con is that this remote is oversized, so it could fit all the function buttons. Otherwise it would garner 5 stars instead of 4. </p>

 <p> works well with my p3100dvd </p>
