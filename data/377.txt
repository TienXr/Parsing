<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> insofar as reading about USOs, which lots of other authors don't seem to touch upon, this book is pretty thorough. the edition being sold now, since the original is OOP, is ok, but it does show some typos and bad editing.the author's style is...silly...but that may be that we of the later decades are just not used to the writing style of the '60s. in some places, he uses "we". i truly hope he means it as "him and other people" and not in the queen of england kinda way, and i do realise that he has an assistant(s), but that's not made clear at the point where he uses "we". he is a bit verbose and repetitive with his personal words, but it's still a good book for the study of USOs. lots of stuff in it that i've never read before and i have really read quite a large number of books on the whole UFO, et al, subject. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Invisible Residents by Sanderson is a remarkable book for anyone who finds to find out more about submersible USOs. This book is must read for anyone who wants to know more about what possibly is going beneath tons of water. According to Wiki.answers.com, "There is (not approx) 17,543,940,979,332,434 gallons of water within the Atlantic Ocean region. Seventeen Quadrillion Gallons! The Pacific Ocean would be around the 35,000,000,000,000,000 mark." [&lt;[...]>} . This makes one wonder if a highly advanced civilization might not have their base on the bottom of planet earth even before the evolution of human species. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> A book that starts well, ends terribly. Sanderson was friends with John Keel and they planned to write a book together, until Keel pulled out. In Invisible Residents, Sanderson ponders, "How is it, I have always wondered, that UAOs [sic] throughout the ages are reported to have appeared in just those forms that were at least partly understandable to those to whom they appeared?" He mentions how impressed he was with Jacques Vallee's Passport to Magonia. Sanderson, however, is slightly more scientific than Keel and Vallee, who both championed Project Bluebook Special Report 14, an unscientific report that maintained that there were no common UFO shapes. Sanderson, however, acknowledges that many UFOs are disc-shaped, but that leaves him in a quandary. Discussing the "damned DISKS", he maintains, "There are no NATURAL, discoidal, aerial objects, and there never have been, as far as we know." So, it appears that his thinking on the matter of UFOs is a mess, and much of the book is taken up with rambling speculation.Sanderson spent his time perusing old copies of Fate magazine, Flying Saucer Review, plus other sources and the bookInvisible Horizons True Mysteries of the Sea. He also includes details of an article plus follow-up correspondence from an article he wrote for Argosy magazine. I found this material interesting. There was an incident where a B-26 plane was enveloped by a small mass of air that had accelerated to 265 knots, the plane had a ground speed of 550 knots. There are also details of strange incidents at Lake Erie, the 1967 Shag Harbor incident and a curious incident when a UFO reportedly dived into the Peropava River in Brazil in 1963, causing the water to boil. There is also mention of a mysterious radio signal that emanated from one of the deepest areas of the Atlantic, 29,000 feet down, not to mention the report of a USO smashing through the ice during Operation Deep Freeze.A book no doubt ahead of its time when it was published in 1970. Still worth a look, plenty of worse UFO books have been written. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I read "Invisible Residents" by Ivan T. Sanders when it was first published in 1970.At the time, it seemed exciting and very mysterious, and I readily accepted Sanderson's writing and premise.  It's funny what 38 years can do!To be truthfull, I was extremely dissatisfied when I started reading this book again. Naturally, much of the information is old and has been inflated and deflated so many times that much of it no longer resembles much of...anything.Sanderson's premise is that; UFO's (or their underwater cousins) are not extra-terrestrial at all, but more than likely craft from earthly residents of an Atlantian type species who have resided here for millenniums long before we exchanged the "flipper" for feet.There are numerous sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USO's) to be sure, and...perhaps the existance of some submarine culture is possible. Who really knows at this point in time?However, Sanderson's "hodge-podge" accumulation of various unsubstantiated reports became...I'm sorry to say, "a boring read." Although Sanderson is typically considered the "Godfather" of USO's, few have ventured past the age of this printing.  Much more study needs to be done in this realm of "UFO-olgy".There is only one such researcher that comes to mind, and readers who are attracted to this subject matter might focus more of their attention on the lectures and writings of Mr. Carl Feindt (as seen on the History Channels UFO series).I appologize to the late Ivan T. Sanderson, but I could only give the book a three (3) star rating at best. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Ivan Sanderson presents some great alternative concepts and answers to some old questions regarding UFO's and USO's. Even though many of his documented and undocumented cases referenced in the book are somewhat vague and unproven, the basic questions of the existence of either extraterrestials or "others" living underwater is a mind provoking thought. Is it possible that an ancient earth lifeform highly superior to "humans" existed long before us, and occupies the underwater domain. I used concepts from this book in my book, "The Nightmare Trilogy", in the first story "Aliens?", where I suggest the aliens are not what they seem, but have been here all along. I certainly recommend the book for anyone seeking thought provoking material to explain some of the documented UFO/USO cases that have been unexplained. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Ivan Sanderson is something of a household name in the realm of paranormal research and publishing.  Invisible Residents was my first foray into his writing, and my expectations were fairly high.  The topic of Underwater Submersible Objects certainly struck me as intriguing.  It's not something covered as frequently as the more familiar aerial UFO, and with so much of the planet's surface being covered in water, the possibilities for interesting investigations seemed great.  Regrettably, I have to report that this read did not fully live up to my expectations.First off, the author's writing style was probably the root of much of my overall dissatisfaction.  Sanderson's prose comes off as particularly long-winded, belaboring even the more interesting of chapters.  Not only does he verbally embellish, but he often wanders far into tangents, leaving the reader wondering just where we are, where we could possibly going, and how the current direction is relevant to the overall theme.Early on Sanderson claims to be of purely scientific mind, giving no quarter the likes of UFO nuts, yet I was not entirely convinced of his rigor.  An entire chapter ("A Sixth Mystery") is devoted a single Colombian artifact which the author states looks like an airplane, thus supposedly proving that the ancients were familiar with modern aircraft.  He goes on to present the artifact to several aircraft engineers who confirm that the object does look sort of like an airplane (but also sort of not).  At no point does he apparently think to approach anyone in the field of Colombian history or anthropology to discuss more prosaic interpretations of the little sculpture in the context of the people and the culture that created it (or if he did, it didn't make the book).  The chapter reads as if the author had immediately assumed it to represent an airplane and simply sought out corroborating testimony to confirm it.  The Egyptians drew plenty of people with animal heads in their day, but it still makes more sense to discuss their culture and artifacts with an Egyptologist; not your local zoo keeper.Although I chose to single out the above chapter, it really highlights what I felt was an ongoing theme, particularly in the later sections.  The author is too quick to make a leap of faith, and treat conjecture as reality.  In some points, he appears to string several such leaps in succession, becoming downright hard to follow.  Reporting incidences of the paranormal is all well and good, but entering the arena of explanation is always dangerous.  I found the final section (Part III) to be the least readable as a whole.  Sanderson jumps around from wild guess, to crazy hunch, to bizarre supposition.  It's hard to tell what he's offering up as fact, what he really believes, and what is just random tangential speculation.  Combined with the general wordiness of the entire book, it became a chore to get through the final wrap up, and in my opinion, it greatly detracted from the whole experience.  I would have preferred the author stick to reporting events as they happened, and leave the reader to draw their own conclusions.Having said all that, it's not all a bad read.  Certain chapters, mostly early on, focus on unidentified object sightings, ghost ships, phantom subs, and mysterious lights.  These are the heart of the subject matter, and what I imagine one would expect from a book on USO phenomena.  Aside from the aforementioned verboseness and occasional directional tangent from the author, these parts read well enough.The book cover of Invisible Residents is boldly subtitled "The Reality of Underwater UFOs."  While I don't honestly expect anyone can provide the full reality of such a complex subject, I do think it would have benefited greatly from a bit more reality, and a bit less of everything else.  What could have been a fascinating look into a rather obscure side of the paranormal was ultimately bogged down by a difficult writing style, a lack of focus on the data, and too much random speculation.3/5 </p>

 <p> Invisible Residents is a fascinating book about something I suspected all along.  It never made sense to me to think that aliens were all visiting us from distant planets because the commute did not seem worth it.  It made more sense to think that they were already living here with a technology more advanced than ours.  The evidence presented in this book is overhwlemingly convincing and made a believer out of me. </p>

 <p> There are just too many people that have witnessed UFOs, USOs, and had alien encounters at many levels, to dismiss the eye witness accounts.

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The Foreword by David Hatcher Childress describes interesting witness reports of UFOs extracting water from bodies of water for some unknown reason and also includes UFO photographs and drawings.  Likewise, the first 45 pages of Invisible Residents by Ivan T. Sanderson describes similarly-interesting USO-UFO events; unfortunately, after that point in the book, which was first published in 1970, Sanderson begins a meandering wondering that dominates the rest of the book and completely loses the direct indications it started with.  Many times while considering a supposedly-unusual event, Sanderson uses a large number of words to conclude that it probably was caused by an ordinary experience.  In Chapter 10 -- The Disposition Of Anomalies, Sanderson describes his "Vile Vortices" theory of lozenge-shaped areas of strange activity circling the center of the globe, but then after mentioning the known issues of earthquakes, volcanic activity, and heavy mineral deposits, makes the bizarre conclusion of:  "It is manifest that we are dealing here with a set of factors that are not, or have not as yet been, correlated with any other physical features of our earth."  On pages 124-126, Sanderson lists Disappearances In Northwestern Atlantic of ships and planes from 1840-1969 as a supposed indication of unusual activity.  In his time, Sanderson seems to have not known that the loss of people, planes, and ships in various areas is part of typical experience; it is now known that volcanic activity and powerful wave actions are the probable causes of lost ships in the Pacific's Dragon's Triangle, and the loss of House Majority Leader Hale Boggs' plane in Alaska most probably happened because of common storm conditions on that day.  In Part Three, Sanderson considers the possibility of underwater beings and cities in the same meandering wondering but does not consider the great physical adversity that such beings would be constantly dealing with and why such beings would choose the harshness of water existence over the ease of land existence.  There may be more to learn about in the world's oceans, but Invisible Residents does not provide a meaningful and well-defined view into such possibility. </p>
