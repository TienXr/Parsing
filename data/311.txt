 <p> What can i say about this book, other than, the techniques and affirmations written by Holmes WORKS! I have been exposed to Holmes' work for a few years, but just for casual reading. Recently, I went deeper than just 'reading for knowledge' to living the knowledge.I was affirming a perfect job with higher salary, and within 1 month, I got a job in another city, and i got a $15,000 increment in salary! (something that a lot of job agents told me is 'impossible' or 'get real'). WHat happened was, my friend called me out of the blue saying his boss suddenly wanted to hire someone with my capability. I sent in my resume, and got an interview. And the old company was having some business changes and decided to split, and I took that as an opportunity to get out. And i went to another city, and got a job immediately.I also treat my health very often and see great result. I once had a condition, and it healed when I affirmed before i sleep. The next day i woke up, its like there was no condition.Holmes' work is thick in wisdom for living. If you are interested, also read books by Thomas Troward. Also get "Love and Law" & others by Ernest Holmes. </p>

 <p> If you make it through this book without actually having some positive affects then you definitely arent paying attention. Some things in here literally changed my personal views the moment I read them. Other stuff took some work. Overall this book gave me a new outlook on my personal situation. </p>

 <p> This is a great book and yet I have a little bit of a problem with it. It's really insignificant, but it still kind of bothers me and that is, the title of the book. You can't change your life. Now hear me out before you think I'm being pessimistic; you can't change your life because your life is essentially that which cannot change. Your life is God Itself...Spirit...it is that which cannot change. Now, by all means you can realign your thinking and by changing your perspective on life it will appear as though your life is changing but only because now you are in alignment...in agreement with what God was ALREADY providing you with; a life that is BEAUTIFUL, RICH, and WONDERFUL; a life where EVERY MOMENT is an opportunity to express Light, extend Love, and experience Life Itself.I recommend this book because it does help you to remember what we already know within; that we are whole and holy beings living in a whole and holy universe right here and right now.Ernest Holmes expresses powerful ideas and amazing insights in this book. Is there anything new in it? Mmmmm...let me think...nope, nothing new but nothing new can be added to Truth because Truth is a constant just like God and cannot be changed, cannot be added to, cannot bend to suit our wants and our needs so if you're looking for something to get "bowled over" with, you're looking for something outside of yourself and not willing to go within. And that's okay, but I would rather go within than go without. Besides, if you're not getting excited or enthused about Truth just as Truth then you're really not hearing it or understanding it because Truth should always be setting off fireworks within our minds, hearts, and souls. We should walk away feeling incredible and then ready to live the stuff out because it works if you work it and it'll work even if you don't work it because the universe is always willing to prove to us exactly what we believe.It's an amazing thing this life we've been given. Let's start today by getting this book and deciding once and for all that we are here to truly live and to live abundantly.Peace be with all of you... </p>

 <p> Dr. Holmes has always known that we much change our beliefs, to change our thinking.Once we change our thinking we can have a better life.  It is all up to us, it is a choice,we make to change our intentions to get a better outcome. </p>

 <p> Unlike many others who read this book, I found the presentation pretty boring.  The thoughts are great but the book was, to me, dull. </p>

 <p> This book was "The Secret" written several years ago.  I believe this book can inspire you to really use your mind, heart and soul to reach your goal, whatever it may be, without losing site of our Creator. </p>

 <p> Excellent book, giving you the tools to really Make a conscious choice on how you want your life to be and to truly live a life on purpose, a life connected to your spiritual essence and a life in peace, no matter what is happening around you. I would also recommend living the science of mind and basic principles of science of mind. A shift in perception that truly will bring about change. </p>

 <p> This book was required reading for a workshop I was enrolled into.  As someone who is an avid reader of The Secret, The Law of Attraction, Ask and It Is Given, Stephen Hawking, and quantum physics; I found this book boring and even offensive.  Had I known Mr. Holmes would vomit scripture throughout this book, I would NEVER have purchased it!  I lost respect for the author when he said The Bible is the most profound book ever written!  He obviously has never studied the historical origins of the bible to make an ignorant statement.  The material is bland and generalized.  I've read much better books that give you examples, activities and creative ideas to manifest the life of your dreams.  See above.  This book is garbage. </p>

 <p> This is a simply written, easy to read book.  It's great when you need encouragement, and helps you step out of the &#34;what is&#34; of your life, when things aren't as you want, and give you good information on how to apply Science of Mind principles. It's very uplifting, giving hope when you aren't finding hope within your life. </p>

 <p> Great little book! </p>

 <p> This book, not unlike all of Ernest Holmes books, is instructional in nature and makes a case for using your mind to get what you want. It's not alot of metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. This stuff works. I read the book all the way through and now I keep it by my nightstand and read sections every night to help me with a situation I may be facing. My life is better for having read this book.The book that got me started down this path is , The Secret by Rhonda ByrneThe Secret. Start here and you will eventually come to know Ernest Homles as the father of the Science-Thought-Mind connection and the Law of AttractionHow to Change Your Life.I am a devout Christian and have given my life to Christ. I assure you that this will only enhance your belief in God and the power of creation.Buy this book and then post your own comments. I know you'll be motivated to tell other people - what a great source of personal success stories - Amazon feedback! </p>

 <p> I am 61. Maybe by this age a lot of things that seem new to others are "same old, same old" to older, well educated readers. Good ideas but as with most good idea books, platitudes and truisims and principles just do not apply to everyone's unique situations. </p>
