 <p> That's what a colleague said to me when she saw my keyboard cover on my MacBook. Besides the fact that it's cool looking and very unique, my keyboard cover keeps out all sorts of dust, dog hair, etc. Plus, I bought another one in green from another company and the color on the keys started wearing away immediately. This one is holding up great. Love it. </p>

 <p> So I ordered this and the shipping was a little on the slow side.  That aside, I noted some reviewers said that the keyboard skin didn't quite match up with the keys in terms of the lights that shine through the MacBook Pro keyboard.  I agree - the letters don't match up exactly but I touch type and hardly look at the keyboard so that wasn't such a big deal.  However, the symbols for the FN keys don't quite match up.  This keyboard skin must have been designed for Leopard or Snow Leopard, because my MacBook Pro is new (less than a month old) and is running Lion - so the symbols on the FN keys aren't quite right.  This might be a problem for someone who primarily uses the keyboard to access Launchpad, Mission Control, or the Dashboard.  As to the keyboard skin, it stays in place, has a bit of a dry feeling, and doesn't impede typing.  I have pets, so my primary reason for purchasing a keyboard skin was to prevent fur getting under the keys.  If you're looking for a keyboard skin, check first if it matches the current OS. </p>

 <p> Looks really good and fits my keyboard perfectly. The only thing that sux is that it gets dirty pretty easily, but you can just take it off and wash it with soap and water. </p>

 <p> The color matches my iPearl hard cover case great.  Only two things to complain about and they're not deal breakers at all.  One, you can't see the green light on the caps lock light up through it and two, it's a little stiffer than it's see-through model, which takes some getting used to.  It brings a lot of character with the added protection (I have to admit I'm not above eating some tortilla chips while doing online school work).  Very easy to clean if needed.  Overall, I'm very happy with it! </p>

 <p> Function and style-- perfect for an Apple! </p>

 <p> So this is mainly to the girls who are planning to buy this product. I bought it for my sister as a birthday gift and she was so happy to get it, because this is a great color and also it manages to save all the dirt from entering your keys and the space between the keys. For all of you who eat and drink while studying this cover protects the keys from having things dropped onto it and prevents from damaging the keys. To wash it just put it in water and scrub it and it is washed. This is very helpful especially for college and high school students who have late nights and need food while studying, I am one and I know how a similar product has saved my computer keys millions of times.Happy studying </p>

 <p> Will definitely repurchase again. For the price, the quality of the material is great. Nice fit... although, the right border shows it has a cut defect... it got rather curved that straight, but I'm not complaining when it comes to the functionality of the product. Nice color... reminds me of yams. </p>

 <p> Great item! So love it! </p>

 <p> Seems to feel a little slippery to type, but for the price and the protection, it's worth it. Color is ok, but could be a little darker purple. </p>
