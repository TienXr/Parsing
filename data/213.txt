 <p> I had this Mill Creek Family set for years today I chanced upon seeing this gem of a movie.Last few months I had seen generally boring movies that are totally uninteresting and bland.Visiting this wondrous movie was a welcome change.Also its the first movie in 3 strip Technicolor and Miriam Hopkins was nominated for Best Actress Oscar.Miriam Hopkins is absolutely wonderful here.Her dialogues are full of wit,humour and liveliness her expressions equally engrossing and most of the time full of mischief and fun.She is not touched by hypocrisy of the world surrounding her and lives life on her own terms even if it is to hoodwink people or to be very clever in her dealings with them.Elspeth Dudgeon plays Miss Pinkerton who takes in Miriam in her school only to save money as she teaches French and dancing for free.In her very cheerful jovial way with mocking expressions which seem so modern Miriam points that to her when Miss Pinkerton gives her a dictionary as a parting gift asking her to be grateful to her saying how she saved so much money for her. And while she is leaving she throws away the dictionary at Miss Pinkerton.Nigel Bruce plays Joseph Sedley and reminds me of an Indian character actor who looked very much like him and even his voice was the same.Don't know his name but he was a common face in 1970's.She takes up governess job at a place where the Maid says to Old Lady "She is on dark amorous errand".Then they bring her suitcase and search through it.Becky (Miriam Hopkins) come in finding the Old Lady of the house looking at a locket with her mother's picture in it which stated she was a dancer.Becky throws a big tantrum is very melodramatic howling and crying and bawling saying her Mother was a rich French Heiress whose wealth was taken away from her and she was exiled by Revolutionaries,that she danced only to clothe her to shelter her.She leaves them in tears,and as she closes the door she waits at the door listening to their tearful reactions smiling from ear to ear at her brilliant performance inside.Also references to India are numerous.Movie is filled with her adventures and escapades and script is so well written her dialogues are sharp and full of direct wit.A movie that you enjoy every time you see it.Hope we would have a good subtitled version one day.Quotes"Royal heads have been known to hop away from their bodies especially in France""I was so sorry to hear about your mother's misfortune,I do hope the operation was successful,To think of her going blind at her age and now she can't recognize her acquaintances,these are glass you are wearing,I hope they would continue to attract men." </p>

 <p> Becky Sharp was a great actress. I just got tired of her using people which was the basis of the whole movie. And then I did not like the ending. It was a like the perils of Pauline if you ever saw that movie. I only gave it a 4 because she play her part very well. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> William Makepeace Thackery's great novel VANITY FAIR was published in 1847--and was considered scandalous for the era, for it presents a corrupt society in which the good fail and the naughty survive.  Chief among the naughty is Becky Sharp, an orphan who has no qualm in using her kind-hearted school friend Amelia Sedley as an entre to society and thereafter has no qualm in crushing Amelia or any one else who comes between her and her materialistic and sexual desires.  VANITY FAIR is a long novel and complicated novel and was significantly edited when it was adapted to the stage under the title BECKY SHARP.  Adaptation followed adaptation, and when it at last reached the screen it was less the original novel than it was a take on the stage's most recent version of previous versions.  Even so, it was still considered scandalous, and it also had the distinction of being the first feature length film shot in three strip Technicolor: the first full-length, feature film in color from start to finish.The use of color was as controversial as the story itself.  Quite a few doctors warned that it could strain the eyes past repair.  Critics wondered if audiences could sit through so glaring a spectacle.  When the film was at last scene, many derried the color quality as artificial and unnatural, and one critic famously said that the colors resembled salmon in mayonaise.  Complaints about the sound quality were also numerous, and the film was scarcely in the theatres when RKO was forced to make a new sound transfer and perform a re-release.  But for all these problems, the film was extremely popular and leading lady Miriam Hopkins was so well liked as the wicked Becky Sharp that she picked up an Oscar nomination as best actress for the role.The book, its various stage adaptations, and to some degree the movie itself anticipate GONE WITH THE WIND, for the heroine is a fundamentally selfish person who cares little for propriety and who's story plays out against the Napoleonic Wars--something in which she has no interest beyond considering it an extreme inconvenience.  Some portions of the story are greatly softened, and not all good people are presented as foolish weaklings, but even so Beck Sharp is a memorably manipulative shrew who lies, cons, steals and sleeps her way to success, living on credit she never pays, and encouraging her husband to use loaded dice when gambling.  This last almost proves her undoing: when her husband must pay a large gambling debt, Becky essentially sells herself to cover the debut, and her husband is not understanding about it.  He leaves her to a downward spiral.  But while Beck Sharp may be down, she is never out.  Later censorship restrictions would have required that Becky pay for her sins, but here she makes a rebound and continues successfully in her wicked ways, entirely unrepentant.Hopkins was a memorable actress, but seen today her performance is a bit too brassy; Frances Dee is perhaps best known for the film I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, and she is charming here, but her side of the story receives less attention in the film, and as such the movie as a whole feels slightly unbalanced. Still, the dialogue is often witty, the satire is sharp and pointed, and the movie can from time to time still shock--as when Becky is at a ball that is interrupted by the battle of Waterloo and shows no great concern for the outcome one way or another; she will profit from whatever side happens to win.Unfortunately, BECKY SHARP has fallen into public domain, and while UCLA has made a restoration of the film it does not seem to be readily available--when you purchase a copy, you're most likely to get painful color balances, grainy images, and yes, the sound really was bad even after RKO fixed it. There are numerous versions available with the ALPHA release probably the most readily available and no better or worse than most. Is BECKY SHARP a great film? No, not really; it is too clunky, too overplayed, it lacks anything that might be described as subtle. But film buffs will find it fascinating, and although Miriam Hopkins plays a bit too much like a slightly off-key trumpet, there's no doubt that she was a great artist. Recommended for film buffs, historians, and Hopkins fans.GFT, Amazon Reviewer </p>

 <p> This review concerns the Alpha Video DVD release ALP4438D.The good news is: Becky Sharp is available on DVD!The bad news is: It's a faded, unrestored, public domain print.The colors look like really bad colorization, or a Metrocolor copy of an Eastman Color copy of a Technicolor film that was copied onto VHS in the slow speed from a 1980's TV broadcast. Get the picture?The sound is somewhat distorted, but listenable.My joy at having Becky Sharp on DVD is only tempered by the disappointment that the gloriously restored UCLA version still hasn't been released except to AMC TV.Many of the UCLA Film and Television Archive restorations have been released by Turner Entertainment on DVD, so why not the original 1935 three-strip Technicolor debut picture? Hopefully with the recent release of Vanity Fair, some DVD producer will go back to Becky Sharp and present her as she was meant to be seen. </p>

 <p> generally regarded as a curiosity for being the first feature-length technicolor movie, this seriously abridged adaptation of thackerays "vanity fair" is actually a decent take on hollywoods translations in the 1930s of 19th century english novels. director rouben mamoulian tries not to pull his punches, tho of course, he has to. the glorious (and sadly forgotten) miriam hopokins has a grand old time in the title role, well supported by a coterie of period english character actors who will be familiar to fans of period movies. i have taken off one * because the sound quality is abysmal, and the film merits a restored version. </p>

 <p> This is a film that is taken from the play "Becky Sharp" by Langdon Mitchell, which is loosely adapted from William Makepeace Thackeray's novel, "Vanity Fair".  The film is only eighty-four minutes long but manages to hit many of the main events in Thackeray's novel, albeit, at break neck speed. More importantly, the main character stays somewhat true to Thackeray's concept of her, unlike Mira Nair's "Vanity Fair", which basically eviscerates the life out of Becky Sharp, the literary character that everyone loves to hate.In this brief film, the viewer sees a grasping, amoral, resourceful schemer who is not above trying on her best friend's husband for size and cheating on her own, as well, if expediency calls for it. We first see Becky leaving  Miss Pinkerton's School for Young Ladies, where as an orphan she had labored,  getting an education, as well as everyone's hand-me-downs. Tired of being looked upon as being less than all the others, Becky is not loathe to leave the school, especially as the wealthy Amelia Sedley has invited her to stay with her until she can find a position. So, after an insouciant departure from the school, Becky is unleashed upon an unsuspecting world.When Amelia finds herself the object of affection of two childhood friends and gentleman soldiers, William Dobbin and George Osborne, she becomes  engaged to George. Becky, having been unsuccessful in luring Amelia's hapless brother, Joseph, into marriage, leaves the Sedley household. She secures a post as governess in the household of Sir Pitt Crawley. There she meets Rawdon Crawley, Sir Pitt Crawley's second oldest son, and the man with whom she falls in love. He assists her in getting a post as a companion to his wealthy elderly aunt, and off she goes. She later marries Rawdon, who is a gentleman soldier and a gambler. They, along with the now married Amelia and George Osborne, find themselves in Belgium, where the Battle of Waterloo is fought. It is there that Becky carries on a flirtation with George. It is there that she also meets the Marquis de Steyne.After Waterloo, Becky and Rawdon find themselves back in England, as Rawdon survived Waterloo. George Osborne, however,  did not. Together, Rawdon and Becky live far above their means. Her desire to rise in society takes some doing, and the Marquis de Steyne acts as her mentor. When Rawdon's gambling debts demand satisfaction, she turns to the Marquis as a last resort, having no other recourse. In return for the money that would ensure the salvaging of her husband's honor, she decides to give the Marquis that for which he has so patiently waited. Unfortunately, the best-laid plans often go awry, and Rawdon and Becky come to an unhappy parting of the ways. Becky's glittering social career comes crashing down upon her.Becky, now down and out, finds herself on the skids, no longer the glittering society hostess.  She tries singing in a music hall. After all, didn't the Marquis find her singing charming? Unfortunately, the paying customers of the music hall have higher standards, when it comes to their entertainment, and Becky bombs. With Becky on the verge of being taking to jail for non-payment of rent for her garret room, Amelia, hearing of her old friend's plight, comes swooping down like a guardian angel, together with her brother, Joseph, and her devoted friend and admirer, William Dobbin. She offers Becky an opportunity to come and live with her, which Becky gladly accepts. Then William objects, given what he knows of Becky, and basically gives Amelia an ultimatum in which she is to choose Becky or him. Amelia, true and loyal friend that she is, chooses Becky. In a redemptive moment, Becky tells Amelia, who has cherished George's memory and failed to see the love that William has for her, the truth about George, opening Amelia's eyes. She sends Amelia after William, while she ponders her future. Then, once again her eyes rest upon Joseph Sedley. So it begins, and so it ends.Miriam Hopkins gives a somewhat histrionic, over the top performance as Becky, but somehow it works. Frances Dee is excellent in the role of Amelia. Nigel Bruce practically steals the show with his portrayal of the bumbling Joseph Sedley. Sir Cerdric Hardwicke, however,  gives him a run for his money as the elegant and faintly sinister Marquis de Steyne. Alan Mowbray is very good in the role of Rawdon. G. P. Huntley satisfies the requirements of the reduced George Osborne role, while Colin Tapley turns in a strong performance as the stalwart William Dobbin.  Billy Burke has a very small role as Lady Bareacres. If you blink, you will miss her.As this was the first film produced in three strip Technicolor, one would think that more care and attention would have been paid to its release on DVD. Unfortunately, with this DVD one gets what one paid for. This bargain basement priced DVD provides the viewer with a grainy print with an occasional audio or visual blip. Moreover, if one is looking for bonus features, one must look elsewhere, as none are to be had on this low rent DVD.This lack of attention to production values was extremely shortsighted of the studio charged with the release of this film, especially in light of the buzz generated by Mira Nair's release of  "Vanity Fair". While the studio timed the release of this DVD just right, they missed the boat by deciding to be penny wise but pound foolish. I myself bought this film after having seen "Vanity Fair" and left wanting more. With the purchase of this DVD,  I ended up getting less.  The film itself rates about four stars, as I enjoyed it overall, being a vintage film junkie. The DVD itself, however,  gets a scant two stars for its back to basics approach and its grainy, audio blighted print. </p>

 <p> A terrific film that unfortunately has not been given the deluxe DVD treatment is seen here is a print much superior to the one available on Alpha DVD. Sharper image, more accurate and pleasant color, but still not quite the ravishing Technicolor print many fans of the film might hope to see. The earlier DVD versions are difficult to watch, but this time around, the sound is of a higher standard, the image is at least clean, and detail is more apparent in the night scenes.Miriam Hopkins is just fine as Becky, and the film itself is fun, bright, sarcastic, and entertaining. Recommended to fans of this, the first three-strip Technicolor feature, since it represents the next stage in evolution on the way to the restoration we're wishing for.No special features, no menu items to speak of, just this acceptable print, and a reasonable price.NOTE: This review applies to the SYNERGY ENTERTAINMENT edition of this DVD, not the ALPHA edition: Amazon sometimes lumps similar reviews in confusing ways (see above, for my review of the Alpha DVD). The Synergy DVD release is much improved, but still not restored. Regards. R. Gorey </p>

 <p> I saw the original Restoration of this Film at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills back in the 1980's when it was initially restored and used as the "KICK OFF FILM" for the decade of Film Restoration, in restoring the older Classic films by the UCLA Film Department to a given film's original quality by Mr. Bob Gitt Head of the Film Restoration Department at the University of California in Los Angeles.  As this was the "KICK-OFF FILM" for the many films in need of Preservation and restoration by the Film Department at UCLA, Headed by Mr. Gitt.  Many Stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood were present that evening including Jane Wyatt, Charleton Heston, and Lyle Wheeler of the Art Department at MGM for many, many years.The Staff at UCLA did a magnificent job in the Restoration of "Becky Sharp" using any and all available prints available at the time they had to work with, which was for the most part, segments of the later Cine-Color prints that had been made from the Original Negative.  In fact, only these Cine-Color Prints were thought to exist, but then an Original Technicolor Print was found in Europe and brought to the Film Department at UCLA to be included with the prints for the Restoration already secured by the UCLA Film Staff.  All but the last 5 or so minutes of the original negative were found for the work to be done on the Restoration Work of this first 3 Strip Technicolor Film ever made.The evening of th Presentation "Kick-Off" at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater located in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Building in Beverly Hills was filled to capacity.  The restored print of "Becky Sharp" including comparison views of the before and after prints were shown, along with original screen tests of the Actors, including those of Miriam Hopkins, Francis Dee,  Alan Mowbray, and even Mrs. Leslie Carter were all shown in the original Technicolor.  A great deal of additional film footage relating to "Becky Sharp" was also shown that evening, and comparisons showing how much work went into the Restoration of "Becky Sharp" for which Miriam Hopkins was nominated for that year in the category of Best Actress.It is regretful what is on this Alpha DVD after all the Restoration work done on this significant first 3 Strip Technicolor film ever produced and Directed by the noted Director Rouben Mamoulian.  Becky Sharp has been shown in the original Restoration on Turner Classic Movies, but to my knowledge, none of the publicly released prints use the Restoration Print, but evidently use the older Cine-Color Prints.  I do know of people that copied it from the showing on TCM, and in that respect do have the restored print, as it is available in Perfect original color, with a great deal of additional film footage of the original screen tests and the making of "Becky Sharp", which was all completed by the Film Restoration Staff at UCLA.  I hope the restored print will eventually be made available for Public sale, as opposed to the current two on the Market now, which are not the restored UCLA Version, but rather the inferior previous Cine-Color versions.  I do know the original restored Technicolor Print is available at UCLA, and has been the version occasionally shown on TCM (Turner Classic Movies).Do not bother with buying the DVD's available to the public by Alpha or another other company selling it publicly, as the quality of the Print and Sound is inferior.  At this point in regards to viewing a good quality print of this first 3 Strip Technicolor Film, the only way I know of seeing the amazing results of the UCLA Film Department's Restoration version is to watch the film on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) when it is shown on Television, and if you have the equipment, then make a copy (if legal) from what is shown, as TCM does use the Restored UCLA Version, which in essence is similar to seeing the film as it looked when it first was shown from the original 3 Strip 35MM Technicolor prints in Theaters when initially released in 1935.  Turner Classic Movies may have the Restored version available through the site on the Internet.  That would be my recommendation if one desires seeing the film as it looked in 3-Strip Technicolor when initially released. </p>

 <p> Becky Sharp (Miriam Hopkins) is a vicious social climber with little regard for other people's feelings. She began as a poor girl, but lied about her mother's background to afford herself a spot on a prestigious finishing school. Her orphaned status leaves her at the bottom of the heap there, but she makes connections that bring her into society. Amelia Sedley (Frances Dee) takes pity on Becky and introduces her to her elite friends, but Becky stabs her benevolent friend in the back by stealing her husband's affections. She doesn't stop there; she uses men for their money on countless occasions and uses her skills to weasel her way out of every bad situation. Her deception is masterful.The cast is the main reason to see this film. The story is slow moving and sometimes difficult to pay attention to, despite the short length of the film. Hopkins is beautiful and adept at playing her ruthless part, and fans will find a way to love her in spite of the character's malice. Cedric Hardwicke, Billie Burke, and Alison Skipworth also star.This movie is notable as being the first feature filmed in three strip Technicolor. Unfortunately, the color is not seen at its full potential with this public domain release. Apparantly, UCLA is restoring the movie and adding some extra footage, but this print has not yet been released. </p>
