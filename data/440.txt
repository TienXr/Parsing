 <p> I enjoyed the juxtaposition of past and present and the devious workings of the human mind.  Characters were fascinatingin their machinations </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Interesting Premise </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This writer gives the impression he hasn't been writing long.  Lots of mispelled words, too much 'fluff' writing.  Does a lot of &#34;uh&#34; and &#34;em&#34; sounds, and I guess it's to try and convey the character can't make up their mind or is thinking...?  Very annoying.  Another thing was his constant use of the word, &#34;snigger/sniggering&#34;.....once might be fine, definitely no more than twice but it's peppered all thru the book.  Based on this story I would NOT ever read another of his books.  I can see why it was FREE, I'd have been really ticked to have spent money on it. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> to hard to keep track of the characters. </p>

 <p> I loved the title but the story made no sense to me. And the dialogue seemed simple. Stay away from the words uh and um. </p>

 <p> An intresting theme.... but it felt like a knock-off of Michael Criton,s "Timeline"Not bad but also not up to Criton ! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Almost, but not quite really good! </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> It's an okay read.  The idea is pretty good. My issue with the story is how broken up it is, characters are introduced throughout without any background. I guess the storyline isn't fluid. </p>

 <p> Really have to pay attention when reading this one. Futuristic - but believable! I found this book to really capture my attention. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Great Story. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The premise was very good, but the heavy-handed attempts at humorous dialog were flat and distracting. You could almost feel the wheels grinding in the author's head.More practice is needed to achieve sparkling dialog.The author was apparently attempting to be witty, but was only half right.Keep trying though, because the story was interesting. Just really work on the "humor", and the dialog.The characters would have been more believable had they been a bit more serious, considering their careers and assignments. And the continuous 'banter' between them was I thought fairly juvenile.I think the author will improve given time. </p>

 <p> It's ok, but... . </p>

 <p> I concur with the others that have reviewed the books, minus the 5 star ones. I didn't finish the book because I was rapidly irritated by something no one else commented on, the formatting, or is it a lack of? It all ran together on my Kindle.If the author were to fix the formatting I would be willing to give it another try. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> About the same as the others... </p>

 <p> I liked the story however it seemed to miss a beat here and there, or maybe it was me. Still a cool story </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Ok </p>
