 <p> In this film directed by William A. Levey (also guilty of directing the classics Wham Bam Thank You Spaceman and Skatetown, U.S.A.), &quot;Dr. Stein&quot; replaces the arms and legs of a black Vietnam vet named Eddie, but something goes wrong and Eddie becomes a murdering, rampaging monster.  This low-budget mess is long on phony-looking gore, but short on plot.  If you're interested in blaxploitation/horror hybrids like this, check out the vastly superior &quot;Blacula&quot; instead.One-half star out of five. </p>

 <p> BLACKENSTEIN is truly one of the worst pieces of cinematic waste to ever ooze forth from the bowels of hollywood! I remember watching this when it came out, trying to enjoy it to no avail. The big-headed monster lumbers sloowwwly along, somehow able to catch and mutilate young ladies, resulting in breast exposure and intestine gooshing. Now, I know this sounds great, but trust me, it is agony to watch! Stick to BLACULA... </p>

 <p> This is a crazy film with only one prime goal in mind - to make blacks look like fools and cash in on black box office hits like Superfly and Shaft!  This is film has the usual black stereotypes: A black sidekick cop named "Jackson," black women always taking their clothes off (the whites ones DID NOT!), a foolish looking square afro, black men who are only concerned with sex even if they have to take it.  If they could have thrown in pimping and drug dealing, they would have.This is one of the few blaxploitation films that I saw that was written and produced by an Italian.  Most were at least produced and/or directed by Jews, while the best of the best were written and directed by blacks.  The writer's (if you can call him that) clear goal was to just make a black version of Frankenstein, even though I never thought of Frankenstein as a race.  I suppose he began his thought processes with curiosities about blacks.  Blackenstein could have had a low hair cut since the guy who turned into him did.  No, he had to make him have a big square afro!The director seemed to have made his plan by assuming that dark scenes means scary!  It could also mean that it was a means to compensate for weak 'special effects.' He also felt that women having their shirts ripped off ala Jerry Springer would be exciting!  It adds nothing to the film and only shows how low some hoes would stoop for a film - a very low budget one at that. I would bet that they got no more than $300 for their parts.Amazon has this film as 1973, but at the end it says 1972.  The source that I got it from said 1974, but it is 1972.  So, Blackenstein can deflect bullets, blows to the head, he can rip arms off without even trying, but in the end, he get's eaten up by dogs?  Who thought about this?  Oh yeah, someone who did not care about blacks but was only trying to make a quick buck and make blacks look stupid at the same time.  I say damn the black "actors" who played in this film.  Is a check THAT important? I guess so since they keep doing it. This is a sad film on all levels.  Stick with quality like Shaft or Superfly.Oh yeah, the only thing good about this was the comdeian on stage with his jokes and his interview by the cops.  HE was the only thing good.  I wish I knew his name... </p>

 <p> Back in the early 1970s someone (producer Samuel Z. Arkoff, I believe) got the bright idea to mix the genres of blaxploitation and horror, the result being the film Blacula (1972), which did well enough commercially to warrant a sequel titled Scream Blacula Scream (1973).  Neither film was particularly favored by critics, but audiences enjoyed them, as they soon developed cult followings.  This prompted others to try their hand at the newly formed hybrid genre, including producer Frank R. Saletri with his release of Blackenstein (1973), which he also wrote.  Directed by William A. Levey (Wham Bam Thank You Spaceman, Skatetown, U.S.A.), the film stars John Hart ("The Lone Ranger", "Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans") and Ivory Stone, in her only silver screen appearance.  Also appearing is Joe De Sue, Roosevelt Jackson (China Heat), Andrea King (The Lemon Drop Kid), and a list of others really not worth mentioning (after watching the film last night I'm betting those that were mentioned probably wish they weren't).As the film begins we see an African American woman named Dr. Winifred Walker (Stone) arriving in California by plane, renting a car, and driving to a large house in the hills owned by her former teacher named Dr. Stein (Hart), who, as we learn later, has recently won the Nobel prize for solving the human genetic code, no less.  Oh brother...anyway, seems Winifred's boyfriend, one Eddie Turner (De Sue), has recently returned from service overseas sans his arms and legs (he had an unfortunate incident with a landmine), and Winifred's hoping Dr. Stein can make him whole again.  Stein agrees to help, and has Eddie transferred to his home, which actually doubles as a pseudo research facility where the doctor performs his wacky experimental testing (Dr, Stein has a whole lot of electrical gizmos whose only purpose seems to be in creating electricity arcs).  As Winifred and Dr. Stein surgically graft some limbs on Eddie (which isn't shown) and begin juicing him up with DNA injections, Malcolm (Jackson), Stein's monosyllabic assistant, falls hard for Winifred, but she turns him out (she's in love with Eddie), to which Malcolm decides to tinker with Eddie's injection formula, enough so to turn him into a hulking, hideous, homicidal brute complete with his very own uni-brow who wears Beetle boots.  While Winifred and Dr. Stein try to figure out the cause of Eddie's de-evolution (Dr. Stein's solution is to up the injection dosage), monster Eddie begins sneaking out at night, at first taking revenge on those who wronged him (like the idiotic, sadistic orderly at the VA hospital), but eventually killing anyone (or anything) that comes across his path.  This, of course, draws the attention of the authorities, eventually leading up to a confrontational sequence hardly worth sticking around for...First off I must say I wasn't expecting much coming into this film as I was resigned to it being a novelty at best.  Problem was, once the novelty wore off, about a third of the way in, it turned into something akin to Chinese water torture, but, being the tenacious movie viewer I am, I plowed ever forward...hey, I figure if I could sit through Jerry Warren's abysmal Frankenstein Island (1981), I could sit through anything (I won't kid you, as Blackenstein did put that notion to the test).  What Blackenstein lacked in competency, it made up for in an overall sense of suck.  You know, I've always admired those renegade filmmakers who don't constrain themselves in terms of such antiquated ideas like a coherent plot, something which others would consider a fundamental aspect of a feature.  To be fair, there is something of a plot here, all of about ten minutes worth (the movie runs about 87 minutes).  I guess one doesn't need a lengthy plot when one has something like 982 establishing shots.  For those not familiar, an establishing shot is one which gives the viewer an idea where parts of a movie are taking place, an example being if a film is set in California, we might see a character flying into a Los Angeles airport.  For some reason director Levey decided it was necessary to show endless exterior shots of Dr. Stein's house, even though it had been established numerous times previously that's where we were at...I guessing this was an effort to pad out the running time, but it could have been a result of lousy direction.  Regardless, if this were the only problem with the movie, I could have let it slide, but there was so much more...the continuity was out of whack (there were many sequences that were supposed to take place at night, except it was obviously shot during the daytime, and vice versa), the pacing was disjointed, due primarily to awkward cut away shots, the film was poorly lit, and the fact whomever placed the music within the film had little idea how to do so appropriately.  There were a number of times some ominous piece of music would start playing, even though the scene didn't call for it...there was also a good dose of soul music included, which didn't really fit in all that well (at least the music chosen), but I half expected that given the blaxploitation elements of the feature.  As far as the actors go, there were two types here...those who've had a viable career in the past, but have found themselves stuck appearing in films like this, and those who've never appeared in a film prior (or since) this feature (the actor who played Eddie had the personality of a two by four).  There was some blood and unnecessary gore (monster Eddie seemed to enjoy pulling peoples faux spaghetti guts from their mutilated corpses), along with a bit of welcomed nekkidness (there's one decent topless scene).  As I said, there's not much of a story, but that's okay because the film is padded out with stupid crapola like a crummy comic (sadly monster Eddie never catches up to this guy) performing in a sleazy nightclub (his material is most definitely rank), followed by an African American woman belting out a soulful tune.  I'm sure if we spoke to the makers of this film today they'd probably make the claim Blackenstein was intended as a parody, but I'll call it what it is, a soulless, craptastic piece of flotsam, one created with the hopes of cashing in on the Blacula films, and failing miserably.  I'm going to give this two stars rather than one for the following reasons...1. It gave me the opportunity to see Frankenstein's monster with an afro.2. The topless girl outside the nightclub.3. It was good for a few laughs.4. The DVD artwork is entertaining.5. Despite the film's overall dismalness, it was still better than Frankenstein Island.The picture, presented in fullscreen, on this Xenon Pictures DVD release, comes across okay, and the audio is clear (there was no mention of the actual format of the latter).  There are chapter stops, but not much in the way of extras except preview trailers of other Xenon DVD releases including Dolemite: The Human Tornado (1976), Durdy Game (2002), Fubar (2002), Tar (1997), Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake (2001), and Welcome to Death Row (2001).Cookieman108 </p>

 <p> Want to recreate a night of ultra late-night 1970s TV in your very own home?  Just slip in a copy of "Blackenstein" and you'll feel as if you're tripping back to that groovy time when you crashed on the couch in your parents' basement rec room and really got into some midnight movie or other.  "Blackenstein" has it all--including a flawlessly scratched and grainy print transferred right onto the DVD.You want bad acting?  You got it.  Factual/continuity/technical errors?  Yep.  Plot holes that an 18-wheeler could be driven through?  Sure.  REALLY bad dialogue ("since the doctor won the Nobel Peace Prize for medicine....")?  It abounds.  Scenes in which someone appears to have forgotten the camera running and, for no apparent reason, decided to include the resulting footage in the film?  You bet.  You name it--if it can be done wrong, it was done wrong in this movie.And for all that, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, because I was laughing my head off most of the way through.  "Blackenstein" is ALMOST, but not quite, what the Wayans Brothers would have made as a student film.  Seen as a bad joke, it's one of the best guilty pleasures ever put on cinema.  If you're expecting a legitimate monster movie, however....just forget it.Some things are truly so bad they're good, and "Blackenstein" fits the bill as well as any other cinematic oopsie I've ever seen.  And it's short enough at 87 minutes that if it does leave a bad taste in your mouth, you'll still have time to put in a "real" movie and possibly salvage your evening. </p>

 <p> BlackensteinThis is my first review of an Xenon Picures DVD release. As normal I tend to focus and award stars on the product and not the movie.Firstly it must be noted that Blackenstein is a low budget movie not expected to make big DVD revenue so I wasn't expecting a fully remastered product with loads of extras however what I got was below par.Most obvious is the 4:3 aspect ratio on the DVD compared to the original 1.85.1 AR in which it was produced (IMDB).  The lack of subtitles is also a big negative. The transfer is a bit below average and it looks like it has been taken off a VHS which might expalin the 4:3 aspect ratio.On the plus side the movie is pretty close to the original run time and also has the complete intro and credits that poor quality DVDs often lack. It does have a limited main menu with scene selection.I would have given this 3 stars but for the hefty price tag of $17. I picked up mine on discount for $4.55 which is closer to what it's worth.  It gets 2 stars.Unfortunately this is the only DVD copy out there so I would suggest fans of this movie wait until this release hits the bargain bins. </p>

 <p> When her boyfriend Eddie Turner (Joe DeSue) returns from Vietnam without arms and legs, Dr. Winnifred Walker (Ivory Stone) appeals to former teacher and Nobel Prize-winning Dr. Stein  (John Hart) for help--and Dr. Stein, who has been fiddling with DNA, accomodates them by growing some new arms and legs.  Unfortunately, the experiment goes awry, and Eddie suddenly develops a square afro, takes to wearing ankle boots, and sneaks out at night... and one of his first victims is an ugly white woman with a really bad hair-do and bad taste in pink nighties.On the surface, BLACKENSTEIN would seem everything a cult-movie fan could ever wish.  And it is true, there are about six &quot;howlers&quot; per minute in this film--actors who can't act, ridiculous dialogue, bad cinematography, awful special effects, extremely silly make-up, you name it, this flick has it.  Trouble is, BLACKENSTEIN is also incredibly, unspeakably dull.  In fact, it is so dull that after about ten minutes its dullness overpowers the giggle factor and you are left to sit in slack-jawed exhaustion.  The DVD offers nothing in the way of extras and the print is bad to boot--not that it makes any difference where this film is concerned.  If you have to buy a gift for some you don't much like, this would be a perfect choice.  Otherwise, steer clear.GFT, Amazon reviewer </p>

In 2006 and only just attempted to rematch it the other day.I ignored the warnings of the Amazon reviewers who said "you're sitting there saying"it's black frankenstein, it'll be the craziest, most awesome bad movie ever! well it's TERRIBLE! DON'T BUY IT!"Everything literally takes five times as long SS it should to happen. Every action. Every dialogue xchange. Literally every movement, every activity. This film is sheer agony to sit through.NOT "Robot Monster" AGONY.NOT "Plan 9" AGONY.REAL, eye-gougingly boring  AGONY!!!!!! </p>

 <p> in the 70's black actor and film makers found a voice in the film world. with movies like "shaft","super fly", and "coffy" movies with black stars and directors were big hits. then the blackexplotion films got hit with low grade movies like this one and it helped kill the market.blackenstein is one of the worst made films of the whole era and features the worst acting,writing, and directing ever seen. but if you like to watch bad movies and laugh you may find some thing good here,otherwise stay away!!! </p>

 <p> One of the so-called &#34;Blacksploitation&#34; genre, this is a really awful film. It can't even be mentioned in the company of a movie like &#34;Blacula,&#34; which, while campy, was not that bad. If you like schlocky movies (as I do) you'll love this one. </p>

 <p> This has got to be one of the most inconsistent films I have ever seen.  Most of the acting is atrocious, the sets in conjunction with the cameras are pretty good, and it features the  Frankenstein equipment from the original film (Strickfaden dragged it out for this film and also Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein).  The plot is time capsule relevant- a black man comes back from Vietnam with no limbs, and his scientist girlfriend contacts her old professor who has a background in cellular regrowth (RNA, DNA mumbo jumbo for plot purposes... now, if RNA causes people to freak out, wouldn't they just stick with the DNA... oh well, it's all for the good of the monster).  Kudos go to this film for portraying a black woman as a take control doctor/scientist and also for portraying VA hospitals as a little subpar (this was the early 70s).  Well, the Basket Case boyfriend has some new limbs thrown on, and a lab assistant with the hots for the girl scientist winds up pulling an Rna switcheroo, causing confusion and disemboweling to abound, (or unbound, depending on how you tie your bellybutton).  Throw in some bad standup, some mediocre Liz Renay, and some great attack dogs and you're in for a weird time.  But just notice the scene shot through the murder victim's droppped eyeglasses, and Blackenstein going out of the lab with his shadow spreading up the wall, and perhaps you'll see what I mean. </p>

 <p> O.K., let me start by saying that I love Black Cinema.  I try to support Black filmmakers and actors/actresses, but come on.  I purchased this movie some time ago (I really just want to forget I spent money on this)and couldn't believe my eyes.  I don't want to sound harsh, but this movie was just plain baaadddd!  I think someone was trying to take the frankenstein legend in a different direction, but it never reached its destination.  Enough said, just don't waste your money or your time.  Sorry. </p>
