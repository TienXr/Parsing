 <p> Let me just say that I didn't really get into this show when the first season was released. Mainly because Urkle didn't show up until mid though the 1st season (he showed up the most starting on disc 3). Then season 2 was released about a year and 8 months later. I really started loving it from start to finish with season 2. It has been 8 months since the release of season 2. Warner, please don't give up on this one. Start feeling the Urkle circle again and come on out with the 3rd season. We are counting on you! </p>

 <p> RELEASE DATE: FEBRUARY 12, 2013, ACCORDING TO: [...]Season 3 of Family Matters only further continues to outshine most, if not all, other family shows. The cast continues to excel at bringing the comedy, fun and very tasteful plot lines in each and every episode. The relationships continue to grow between Steve and the Winslows.Episode 1 - Boom: In this episode, Carl has to deal with a potentially explosive situation and Steve gets a new friend.Episode 2 - Brain Over Brawn: In this episode, Steve demonstrates that muscle and physical strength aren't all that matters - and in a very moving heart to heart, we get that glimpse of the growing friendship between Steve and Laura.Episode 3 - The Show Must Go On: When Laura is cast as Juliet for a school play and her fellow castmember playing Romeo falls ill, the part falls to.. who other than Steve Urkel? In what all fans have waited to see, Steve finally gets something he's waited, according to him, 'forever' for.Episode 4 - Words Hurt: In this episode, we're made to finally see that even Steve is hurt by words - this episode touches on the importance of words and how they can hurt others.Episode 5 - Daddy's Little Girl: In this episode, Laura meets Carl's new partner - and tries to grow up too quickly.Episode 6 - Citizen's Court: In this episode, Carl and Steve's friendship is put to the test when Steve takes Carl to court.Episode 7 - Robo-Nerd: Steve gets too inventive and creates a Robotic Steve, wired with all the same personality traits and feelings of the genuine article. This ends up being a problem when Laura is brought into the mix.Episode 8 - Making The Team: In this episode, Steve desperately tries out for the basketball team, only to be told he's not good enough. Surprisingly, Laura is told the same thing when she joins the cheerleading squad. In what's surely a defining moment for both, they stand up for themselves and each other.Episode 9 - Born To Be Mild: In this episode, a new gang destroy's Rachel's place and gets violent towards the Winslows.Episode 10 - The Love God: Carl goes undercover as a street girl and Steve tutors a fellow classmate. Steve also shows his character when he goes beyond tutoring her and helps her to better herself.Episode 11 - Old And Alone: Laura gets upset at Steve for interfering in her love life and tells Steve to leave for good.Episode 12 - A Pair Of Ladies: In this episode, Harriet decides to help out at Rachel's place and Steve joins a poker game with Carl and his officer buddies.Episode 13 - Choir Trouble: Rachel gets promoted to being Choir Director, but lets the position go to her head, causing the entire choir to walk out on her.Episode 14 - A Test Of Friendship: The Winslow House is completely robbed - while Carl sleeps through the robbery; Eddie asks Steve to help him cheat on a test but when Steve gets caught, it puts their friendship to the test.Episode 15 - Jailhouse Blues: Their cousin Clarence comes to stay with Laura and Eddie - but it isn't all good. Clarent winds up getting Eddie and Steve arrested.Episode 16 - Brown Bombshell: Steve has to confess to Carl that he has misled a female convict into thinking Carl has fallen for her and Grandmother Winslow tries to teach her grandchildren about their family history. This episode is particular touching and memorable for it's emphasis on the Tuskegee Airmen from World War 2.Episode 17 - Food, Lies & Videotape: Steve, Laura and Waldo take Home Ec - with surprising results. Richie learns a lesson about telling the truth.Episode 18 - My Broken-Hearted Valentine: A very, very good episode - When Laura dates Daniel Wallace, he tries to pressure her into having sex but in a outstanding display of character and value, Laura stands up for herself.Episode 19 - Woman Of The People: Laura decides to run for Class President against Cassy Lyn, leading to a clash of dirty politics.Episode 20 - Love And Kisses: Harriet and Carl take an anniversary trip - which looks to be a disaster when they wind up in a hotel room that only has three walls. Steve scores a private concert with Johnny Gil for Laura.Episode 21 - Stop In The Name Of Love: - In an effort to boost Waldo's self-confidence, Laura goes on a date with him; Estelle crashs into Carl's boss' car, leading him to crack on Estelle's driving constantly.Episode 22 - The Urkel Who Came To Dinner: - When Steve's parents go on a second honeymoon, the Winslows invite Steve to stay with them.Episode 23 - Robo-Nerd II: Steve finally reprograms Robo-Nerd to be a robotic police officer. Laura convinces the women of the Winslow household to try out new hair producsts with undesired results.Episode 24 - Dudes: Eddie, Laura and Waldo go on the show 'Dudes' to try to get new dates but it winds up being a fiasco.Episode 25 - Farewall, My Laura: Laura and Rachel read a short story Steve submitted to a writing contest.5 Stars the whole way for this Season. </p>

 <p> There are some sitcoms that have shows that were good for its time; I put The Cosby Show in this category(few shows have much lasting value). Family Matters whether its Urkel or preUrkel will have that lasting value! Watch as many of the included list as you can and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about!The person/people behind the Urkel idea had to somehow had been inspired by Dennis the Menace. Carl Winslow became Mr. Wilson and Steve Urkel was a hyper educated Dennis.Family Matters was a part of TGIF(thank goodness its Friday). ABC had a varying lineup over the years: Dinosaurs; Step-by-Step; Full House; Boy Meets World; etc. What I remember most about the show was how Steve(king nerd) wanted Laura(the show's vixen) more than he wanted to live, she spurned him as if he was rotting cheese every time until the last season or two; Steve mostly builds crap that malfunctions to everyone else's detriment, but every once in a while he follows through with a gem of a device/invention(transformation chamber, Urkebot/cop, cloning chamber, a back rocket, etc.); and Steve always manages to irritate, surprise, and befuddle those in his path(namely, Carl Winslow and his family). My most memorable stars were: Urkel and Waldo. My favorite guests/regulars were: Lieut. Murtaugh; Weasel(loud-talking and arrogant); Capt. Savage; Cassy Lynn; Myra; Rodney; Willie(Larenz Tate); and Stephan Urkelle.The most memorable shows are these: The very beginning; The A-bomb show; the Urkel bot/cop shows; the report card show(Carl gives incentives for A's); the show where Steve gambles at poker with Carl's friends and boss; the show where Steve dates a nerd girl Susie; the home ec cooking show; the show where Steve glues his hand to Laura; the show where Ted hints that Laura is EASY; the show where she takes him back; the show where Steve floods the junior prom; the show where Laura dates Waldo; the parrot show where the parrot repeats, "Guiess[Carl`s boss] is an idiot!", after hearing Carl say it; the show where Loonay(it's French) gets married to someone he doesn't even know; the shows where Laura and Myra feud over Steve(cafeteria and beyond); the show where Carl forces Eddie to play basketball(Will the Thrill); Steve thinks Rachel likes him; the show with Buddy Goodrich; the pool hustle(Bullwater, Tx); the first Stephan Urkelle; the 2 episodes where Carl faces life as a nerd; the Shanice show; the Tracy Spencer show(Waldo blasts through an apartment window); Maxine, Laura; Stephan; and Curtis are at odds(Boston cremes); Eddie's hot stereo; Steve and Laura see each other naked; the cloning episode; Eddie becomes a cop; Eddie is too trigger happy for being a cop/Steve is being spied on by Myra(custom glasses); Stephan and Steve play as each other; Steve and Myra break up for good; the Disney World episodes; both Aunt Oona(Donna Summers) episodes; the Christmas show where Christmas tree star lights up on its own at shows end(the original--some re-airs cut that part)/Steve and Laura switch places on this show; the show where Harriet goes to get Laura in her curlers(curfew); the roommates blow up Waldo's stove; the termites show; the shrunk/giant cat show; the family goes to a shrink over Steve; Carl's bombshell partner; Greta first episode; show where Laura and Eddie feud (ending with Eddie in a room full of angry women--Greta included); show where Steve dressing up as Superman for Halloween and he and Laura get robbed while making a bank deposit; first Rachel's Place; Greta and Eddie see each other using Steve behind their boss'(Greta's dad) back; Greta poses naked; the guns episode; the Elvis(transformation) show; and the show where the gang goes on a talk show called Tiffany to hash out some issues.If you watch those shows you'll be rolling laughing or peak your interest! It comes on on BET! No other shows has this many memorable episodes: not Cosby; not Fresh Prince; not anybody! </p>

 <p> No other sitcom--maybe show period--has this many memorable shows! That's a permanent mark of how great it is! </p>

 <p> I recently bought Season 3 of &#34;Family Matters&#34; and the show is one of my childhood favorites so having it means a lot to me. But I've got a bone to pick with Warner Home Video over the technical aspects of this release. for example the first two seasons of the show that were released on DVD contained English stereo surround sound audio (2.0). But for whatever reason, that is not the case for Season 3. Season 3 is in Mono Dolby Digital sound. The sound is coming through one channel: the center speaker. The sound quality is terrible. It might be ok if someone is listening through tv speakers, but if they can give their releases of The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men Widescreen transfers and 5.1 soundtracks, then they can at least give FM a stinkin 2.0 track and SOME special features. Season 4 is due out in February. I want it but Warner Bros had better get it together for that release. </p>
