 <p> This is the charming sequel to &#34;Prancer.&#34;  You do not need to be a child to enjoy this movie; all you need is to still have the sensitivities you once had as a child.  Sit back and revisit your childhood. </p>

 <p> Very loving story to continue with the first movie of Prancer.  Still keep's the heart warming message of the original and worth getting to watch with the original one. :)  I enjoyed the movie with my holiday collection for the Christmas and New Years season.  My daughter even enjoyed it. </p>

 <p> The reindeer was cute and so was the little boy...but that's probably the best thing that I can say about this movie. The story wasn't memorable at all as I can't even remember it off the top of my head and the acting was subpar at best.  If you think you'd enjoy a Christmas fantasy about a child and one of Santa's reindeer, watch the original.  It was well acted, well done and a is a joy to watch! </p>

 <p> The original Prancer is such a favorite of mine that I kept 2 copies so I would always have one to watch.  This sequel, even with different cast, is just as enchanting.  The disc was perfect and delivery was prompt. </p>

 <p> The description misleads. It says "Fullscreen", but it's not. It's "Widescreen". I might have bought it anyways, I don't know, but it should have been my choice. I prefer"Fullscreen", but sometimes I buy "Widescreen" if I like the movie. Anyways like I said it should have been my choice. Amazon should put the right information in the product description. And match the right reviews to the right movie or boxed set. A lot of times there will be mixed reviews like with disney there will be masterpiece, platinum, etc., even vhs, reviews within the same movie. I have to wade through all of them just to find the ones that pertain to the movie I'm thinking of buying. </p>

 <p> For those of you who have already seen Prancer Returns, here is the lowdown on the DVD release.  Amazon's specs are incorrect; the movie is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen (16x9)!  This release has no real special features that can be accessed on a DVD player (the back of the case lists chapter selection as a special feature), although it does have a few DVD-ROM games that can be accessed on a computer.For those who are unfamiliar with the story, but are contemplating a purchase, let me advise ordering the original Prancer instead.  There isn't anything necessarily wrong with Prancer Returns, but it just feels like a rehash of the far superior original.  Prancer Returns has a passable, although predictable, story, which is quite reminiscent of the first film.  The story isn't as downbeat as the first, and features a few comedic bits; although the comedy generally detract from the overall feel and flow of the rest of the film.  The acting is a mixed bag.  Jack Palance turns in a great performance as the grouchy neighbor.  Gavin Fink does an acceptable job as the protagonist, but can't carry the movie nearly as well as the girl from the original Prancer.Prancer Returns is a good companion to the first movie.  Unfortunately, it also remind us of how much better the original is. </p>

 <p> Prancer Returns </p>

 <p> I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that an eight-year old Charlie Holton's life is about to change. Deep in the mountain woods, he discovers a gangly baby reindeer, all alone. Believing this must be Prancer, Santa's reindeer, Charlie takes the gentle creature home to care for him until Christmas. Charlie even emails Santa Claus, telling him to pick up Prancer on nearby Antler Ridge on Christmas Eve. Charlie's quest to return the reindeer marks a dramatic change in the lives of Charlie and his family as, struggling and nearly broken, they are returned to love through the magical appearance of the reindeer. Prancer Returns is the story of how one boy's faith in humanity can bring hope and happiness to a family, a town, and especially to himself. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people. </p>

 <p> Sequals are rarely successful, but this film proves the exception. It is at least as good and in some ways better than the original &quot;Prancer&quot;. It is a really nice holiday story that should please both children and adults. Yes, it is a fantasy, but one grounded in reality which makes it the best kind of make-believe. From the opening, the viewer knows what the results will be. It is obvious who the divorced mother will end up with, the reindeer will actually be one of Santa's and the unpleasant person will get his just dues, but the way the events unfold make it a really enjoyable story. The characters are true to life with excellent preformances from the children. This could become a Christmas classic. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A continuing story of Prancer by way of his "Son" </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This segment of the "Prancer" release of 1989 does a fair job of connecting with the original not trying to duplicate the story but instead just offering a later and continuing story instead.Not as good as the original in my opinion only but I feel anybody who liked "Prancer" will also like "Prancer Returns" and I am glad I purchased both because they do refer back to the original connecting the two stories well but without any of the original actors or actresses or scenes so all new viewing as far as people portrayed are concerned.As in the original many live and real outdoor scenes will be shown as well as real animals shown interacting with the cast at various times.This video is excellent to view after the first "Prancer" but by itself might lose some of it's charm not knowing what is being referred to first hand during the "Prancer Returns" segment of this story, which seems to leave itself open for an almost annual updated segment as the generations of "Prancer" might continue.I rate it as a good family film/video for the entire age group a family may consist of to be viewed around Christmas for full effect..The town it was filmed in and around will be noted in the credits, if you watch both "Prancer videos" look for any difference from the first to the second releases. </p>

 <p> It's certainly easy to dismiss this made for cable sequel as merely a retreading of the original.  But it's heart is so big and the production is so well done, PRANCER RETURNS stands on its own wobbly feet.  This time, it's Prancer's son who brings the magical mystery alive, and Gavin Fink as Charlie is an endearing waif.  Robert Clark as his older brother is also fine in his role.  The adults, John Corbett-Stacy Edwards-Jack Palance-Michael O'Keefe--are also credible and the heartwarming message of belief and family values are also well ensconced in its storyline.  The relationship between the brothers is especially touching and the movie's predictable ending is still magical to those of us who still have that whimsical belief in Christmas magic. </p>

 <p> A sequel to the earlier Prancer and takes place in the same town years later. A boy finds a injured reindeer and and sees it happen to be the reincarnation of Prancer and nurses it back to health.Very modern than the original,as the town folks make it a traditon to celebrate each christmas the missing reindeer from there town street display. I liked the original better as it seemed to be more grounded with the storyline. The sequel is cute too in it's own respect </p>
