<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> With the Olympic Games grabbing their share of the headlines these days, let's look at a film about an athlete "coming out" in another country ... Iceland."Eleven Men Out" (Iceland, 2005) is about a soccer star on one of the best amateur teams in that country, who abruptly decides to "come out" as gay, much to the surprise and complete shock of his teammates, father (who is apparently the head coach of the team), mother, siblings, ex-wife and teenage son. It doesn't go well, with his son ashamed of him, his ex-wife using it as an excuse to relapse with an alcohol problem, and the team trustees benching him until they eventually decide he can no longer play there.  A friend who coaches a lesser-known (and apparently much more diverse, with several openly gay members) team invites him to join, and the "Pride" - which becomes almost 100% gay as others hear about it - starts to rack up victories, eventually taking on his old team, in a sold-out game on Gay Pride Day in Iceland.It's a pleasant coming-out story, but seems more like a documentary than a film with characters and a plot.  We never really get to know Ottar (the player who "outs" himself) beyond the facts that he has a past and is somewhat self-centered in not considering (and preparing others for) the possible implications of his announcement to the press, as well as in dealing with a teammate he starts dating.  Some of the dialogue seems ad-libbed and frivilous, but that could be due to the fact that I was following English subtitles (The film is in Icelandic).  Several seemingly gratuitious shots of the players in the shower make this seem almost like a "Full Monty" remake at times, and the ending - though perhaps realistic - is too abrupt.  Similar stories have been told better, and this could have been too.DVD includes several featurettes about gay amateur athletes. I give it three stars out of five. </p>

 <p> Shows that prejudices and hard headed people are all over the world as these guys from Iceland must deal with the gay bashing while trying to compete as a gay soccer team.  It all starts with the star of a popular soccer team announcing to the press after a game that he's gay.  This doesnt go over well with most of the folks on his team his dad included being that he's the coach of the team.He talks to him like its a sickness or a mental illness that can be "cured" when that drama stop for real.  He's not hearing any of it at all and he's also dealing with a way drunk and so out of it ex-wife.  He also has a son to look out for as well and he isnt too keen on him putting his business out for the world to see.But throughout the movie the gain more favor with other folks who don't have an issue with an all gay soccer team.  It's filled with drama and what not, but its also a fun movie that most should be able to enjoy. </p>

 <p> You may want to see the special features about gay, American athletes before watching the film.  See, the US has "Personal Best" and "Breaking the Waves" about athletes in individual sports, but this Icelandic film breaks new ground by focusing on team sports.  Still, there is a wide golf between professional sports in the US and intramural stuff.  I guess "leagues" are more popular in Europe and having a league player come out won't translate as much here.  There are whole gay sports leagues in the US, whereas few athletes, of any sexual orientation, will ever make the professionals and get nationwide attention.That being said, this film does touch upon so many important point.  If one player comes out, how will his straight teammates respond?  How will the opponents respond?  Does having one out player make a team "gay"?  Will it attract more openly gay players?  Will straight fans disappear and will gay fans mitigate that loss?As needed as this film is, it also felt rushed in so many areas.  The athlete comes out for a dumb reason at the start of the film and does not calculate things in his head the way any reasonable, closeted person would do.  He gets introduced to another gay athlete one second, and BOOM!, they are getting down with each other the next.  The main character's son walks in on his father getting busy and any reasonable parent would have locked the door or their Spidey sense would have told them their child could show up.  Of course, all of this is done to keep up the tension and conflict and get the ball rolling, but it is still highly unrealistic.I saw this film using a certain red-envelope service.  It said the film was in English with English subtitles; it is actually in Icelandic with English subtitles.  (I heard that many Northern Europeans speak English, so the first scenario sounded plausible.)  Obviously, there are cultural gaps here.  The son is called "Maggi," which I later learned was short for "Magnus."  However, "Maggi" sounds like a girl's name to my American ears.  Think about Maggie Simpson, for example.  One minor character seems to be into Black American hip-hop culture.  He uses some slang and has African-American film posters on his wall.  However, he wears a cowboy hat and many hip-hop B-boys would think of themselves as the antithesis of cowboys.  As a side note, the main character and his ex-wife look WAY too young to be the parents of a teenaged boy.The film fights the image of Iceland as homogenous by showing people of color.  There's a Black, gay man on the team.  (How many brothas live in Iceland!?)  The film seems to be dedicated to a late, biracial male.  The film tries to be bisexual-friendly by having the main character get with his ex.  Like many a gay film, the straight characters often find romantic partners of their own, thus sending the tacit message that gays don't stop straights from getting lucky.  On a possible PC note, one man is seen in a wheelchair using oxygen.  Unfortunately, he says close to no lines, makes no movements, and thus his character may be static, in a problematic way.The film does have a shower scene, for us horny viewers.  Still, parents in Iceland must not get a certain procedure done for newborn sons that American parents usually choose, if you know what I mean! </p>

 <p> This movie did have a good story to tell but it was slow in telling.  However, acting was fine and it was another movie for telling the family a story. This covered a man coming out into the big world and took a big chance. All of the public was involved and so were the reactions of his family members, especially a son. Overall, as I said it was OK. Acting was good and the story line was fine for a beginner to see. </p>

 <p> A little disappointed in this film. I purchase few films &#34;sight unseen&#34;, but I did this one as I have enjoyed many foreign Gay films. The idea was good, and certainly current in nature. A favored sports figure comes &#34;OUT&#34;, and the affect of this on various aspects of his life. However, the film didn't flow well, seemed disjointed. Maybe could have spent less time on playing the game and more time on other things. </p>

 <p> The story is, if you can call it that, that a prominent icelandic soccer player comes out after a match so that he can be on the front page of a magasine. After that he gets kicked out of his club, finds a gay team (you don't see them play), they drive around to some small villages to play and ends up playing against his old team mates, and then the movies ends...oh yah you find out that he's been married, has an estranged son and he plays boyfriends with one of his gay team mate.Boring, boring, boring. I am sorry i wasted money on the film. </p>

 <p> This is a slick film coming from an interesting place, Iceland, filled with sorta cute people (of both genders) and some interesting family dynamics, and the main plot circles around a sports star.  This film had lots of potential.In a nutshell, the central figure, an Icelandic soccer ("football") star, Ottar, decides to come out as gay in order to be on the "front page" of a magazine.  This leads to problems, as the Icelandic people are evidently quite homophobic, and Ottar is sent packing, his family is enraged/horrified, his son ostracized, and his wife/girlfriend/son's mother is driven further into her liquor-induced semi-coma.Fortunately, there is another soccer team which is more accepting, and Ottar decides to give it a try on a new team, essentially forming a team of gay and gay-friendly men who become quite successful, mostly because nobody else will play them.This film fails, mostly, because of a flaw in the story.  You never get the chance to know or like Ottar beyond the plain facts that he is an attractive, spoiled, self-centered egotistic dummy who does whatever he wants without really thinking his actions or their consequences through.  As such, it's hard to generate much emotional investment in his welfare or the conflicts in the story.  The supporting characters are equally shallow, and you are left with little to watch.Beyond this flaw, the story wanders all over the place, the resolution is still-born, the dialog is filled with witty banter like "shut up," and the sum of the parts is unspectacular.Ironically, there is a trailer for "Guys & Balls," on this DVD, which is a German film with a very similar plot, done with much more style and grace (and humor) which is far more worth your time.  I'd skip "Out" and enjoy "Guys and Balls" instead. </p>

 <p> "A hilarious comedy?" "A crowd pleaser?" That's what it says on the box. Ah, no. Was it Rocky? Kramer VS Kramer? Funny? NO! Another tired attempt at a 'gay' movie. Forget romance. There's none. Oh, except, 'Blow me," uttered by the star during one scene. After his gay boyfriend does, our 'gay' soccer star, who came out in the first scene just to be on the cover of a magazine? Err okay, why? He, for no reason...sleeps with his --beastly-- alchy trophy wife. Gag. Has a son who seems more gay than he does, and is certainly old enough to get a clue, mopes around more than a cartoon parody of something from South Park. A film filled with cliche' parents, soccer coaches, teammates and more homophobia than is believable in a 2005 release. And it even had an ending that was not worth the agony of the 84 excruciating minutes of 2 dimensional characters. Not one character was explored in depth. Not even the beauty of the leading man could hold me for this one. Why can't anyone make a decent gay movie about love, pride, romance and leave out the pathetic done again and again sappy BS? Another waste of good income. Skip it! </p>

 <p> This is an identical plot to the German movie Guys and Balls but their like stops there. As one is fun, energetic, spontaneous, and likable, the other is not. They are both made by the same production company.Eleven Men Out is a very depressing, serious, and awkward movie where the acting is barely passable. And I did not like that the main character's son gets caught in the middle of his father coming out and his mother being a slut and a drunk.This is an Icelandic movie. Basically the plot is based on a famous local football player playing for the first and most popular team in Iceland. He announces in the beginning of the movie that he is gay just to get a story and a picture in the local magazine. Then he joins a third rate all gay team.The rest of the movie is the tribulations of him adjusting to his new life and team. His father is a psychiatrist and a member of the board of his former team. At first his former team chastises him but toward the end this team tries to get him back. There is a game at the end of the movie between the gay team and this straight team. The gay team fails miserably (unlike Guys and Balls.) Also there is a father and son portrayed in Guys and Balls, healthy relationship, unlike this movie.I liked the movie for his cultural information, otherwise I disliked the movie for everything else. </p>

 <p> Dull, confusing movie from Iceland about a gay football player coming out of the closet, much to the consternation of his family and teammates.  This one is populated by incredibly unpleasant characters, not the least of which is the protagonist.  Men, women, kids, gay, straight, there isn't a likable one in the bunch.  It is hard to work up much interest in these people, or care in any way what happens to them.I'm not sure what "Eleven Men Out" is supposed to be:  comedy, drama, comedy/drama?  Whatever it is, it doesn't succeed in being any of them.  Maybe something is lost in translation.  Is it a message movie about acceptance and self-respect and being honest with others and yourself?  Who cares? </p>
