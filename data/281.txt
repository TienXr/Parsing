 <p> This was a very well made show, gave you some insight of what these people may have gone through also on how they lived. Would tell others this is a great one to watch to find out about what happened when the volcano erupted. </p>

 <p> "Pompeii: Back from the Dead" is a fascinating look at a unique find of human skeletons uncovered in a Pompeii cellar, likely some of last to perish in the Mount Vesuvius eruption in the summer of 79AD. Unlike most remains that were buried in ash and subjected to extreme heat, these were somewhat protected by being enclosed in the cellar. This documentary explains the events that lead up to Pompeii's final days, how the people likely reacted, and what anthropology archeologists can determine from the well preserved remains found at the site. There is also a good deal of speculation and discussion on the "intimate" habits of the residence of Pompeii as remembered by history and depicted in the surviving frescoes.This will be worthwhile watching to anyone interested in Roman history!Recommended!CFH </p>

 <p> Took me back to the time and how the people lived.  From the forensic evidence attempts to recreate a segment of the lives of those left behind.  Told more than just what happened. </p>

 <p> I enjoyed watching this particular documentary as it was interesting to see what factors scientists and archaeologists use to determine what happened on that tragic day. The commentator was also easy to listen to and very clear picture. </p>

 <p> A very descriptive documentary about a historical event almost beyond belief. I think it remains a great lesson for the present and future because we all live on the planet Earth! I think you will find it most rewarding to gain this knowledge and will never feel your time was too valuable not to know the vast array of information waiting to be discoved in this film. </p>

 <p> A must see if you have ever heard of Pompeii, and especially if you have not. </p>

 <p> If the set-up of this documentary had been a bit more straight forward, it would have engaged me more. The information is interesting and very well, if in painful detail, delivered.However, it takes about fifteen minutes into the show before you realize that you're going to be examining recently discovered bones from Pompeii and why that is significant. </p>

 <p> The Discovery Channel is not in the business of education, but entertainment, which is why it repeatedly puts out programs like this that are not only short on facts, but often distort and misrepresent facts. Sometimes, they even stoop to making things up and presenting it to their unsuspecting audience as if it were, indeed, an established fact. Pompeii: Back from the Dead is a perfect case in point. Here are a few of the departures from reality featured in this &#34;documentary.&#34;1) The show's theme is the town of Pompeii; however the focus of the show is a group of skeletons found several miles away in a different town; Oplontis. There is no definite link between these skeletons and Pompeii, except that they died in the same volcanic eruption, but the show consistently refers to the bodies as being Pompeiian.2) The show proclaims that one skeleton in the find is an &#34;African&#34; male. This is based on what??? Since it has been scientifically established that race cannot be determined from bones, how did they reach this startling conclusion?? Was there DNA found?No---a little research reveals that one Italian anthropologist pronounced the skeleton to be African based on the shape of the skull---a practice long since debunked, and a conclusion discredited by the archaeological community: in short, everybody in the field has rejected this anthropologist's sensationalistic claims. The show never discusses any of this--it takes the false identification and runs with it.3) The earthquake--and resulting claims of the show; The show presents the possibility that a major earthquake rattled the region of Pompeii a week before the eruption. More than likely true, given the typical geological activity leading up to a large volcanic event. However, the show postulates that this led to an evacuation of the local population a full week before the eruption. There's no such evidence. In fact, when a major earthquake rattled the region 17 years previous, in 62 AD, no such evacuation took place. People don't generally abandon their property and livelihoods following an earthquake. They pick up the pieces and get back to work. This whole line of reasoning is just put forth to support the show's premise---that the skeletons found at Oplontis were evacuees from Pompeii. Again zero evidence.4) A gladiatorial show taking place at the time of the eruption; the show specifically claims that an &#34;ancient Roman source&#34; records said event. This is a blatant falsehood. The &#34;source&#34; is the Victorian author of the melodramatic novel &#34;The Last Days of Pompeii,&#34; in the 1800s. There is no such Roman account as the documentary claims.There are plenty more misrepresentations, exaggerations, etc., but I've listed some of the more egregious ones that irked me.  I'm afraid you're not going to learn much from this show other than a lot of conjecture.5) Herculeaneum: The show states that the nearby town of Herculeaneum was destroyed, like Pompeii, by the same pyroclastic flow. If you've done any study of this period and event, than you already know that this is not the case. Herculeaneum was destroyed by a volcanic mudslide of super-heated mud, which is somewhat different than the pyroclasim that obliterated Pompeii. This in itself may not seem that important, but it is representative of the sheer sloppiness and disregard for facts of this documentary. Obvious it was not intended for a knowledgeable audience, but I just can't stomach the idea that misinforming an uneducated audience is the way to go with a show that, at least, claims it is informative. In short, the only thing you will really learn from this show is a host of speculations and falsehoods. </p>

 <p> I stumbled upon this by accident and watched some of it. It was not realistic: much of the so-called facts are simply speculations and inferences that cannot be proved.  It would be better to call it a low budget movie then a documentary. </p>

 <p> Pompeii - Back From the Dead is a short documentary type show that goes over some possibilities and theories of the Pompeii tragedy. The excavation evidence is shown as well as reenactments to beef up their ideas about what happened.I am interested in this huge volcanic eruption and found this show to be fairly entertaining and interesting, although, like others, I take it for face value. All anyone can do is make an educated guess. </p>

 <p> It has been said that history not only brings the dead back to life but also assures that they continue to live through our memories.  This production certainly helps to lend validity to that statement.We sometimes forget that there is really little difference between ourselves and the people who lived so many centuries ago.  And thanks to the discoveries examined in this show, we have learned even more about the eruption and subsequent destruction of two thriving towns and the people who resided there.  Especially upsetting is the way death overtook them. Even those who thought they were safe in the underground room had no way of knowing that nothing could save them.I give it four stars because of the not-so-subtle pushing of a politically correct diversity agenda.  Enough already; it does grow old after a while. </p>

 <p> I have had the privilege of touring Pompeii and have watched other documentaries about the area.  However, the discoveries of the 54 people who died in the cellar is interesting.  Worth watching for those who are interested in the subject. </p>
