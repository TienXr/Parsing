 <p> Mike Myers joined "Saturday Night Live" in 1989 and stayed on for 6 years, bringing with him a wild assortment of wild and wacky characters that were punctuated by Myers' wit and energy. This 16 - sketch dvd (21 if you count the bonus skits) succeeds at capturing the seasoned canuck at his best, with most (not all, I'm sure) classic characters at their best, from "Philip" to "Wayne's World" to the creepy "Sprockets".All of Myers' most well - known characters get their due. His perennial Wayne from "Wayne's World" is represented here with 3 sketches (counting the bonus sketches), including the classic Madonna dream sequence. "Coffee Talk With Linda Richman" gets 2 skits as well. One is the infamous Barbara Streisand, Madonna and Roseanne one. The other one is on the bonus page. It's from when he hosted the show in 1997, so you know it's not that good. Finally, there's the eerie humor of Dieter from "Sprockets", which also gets 2 skits, including the creepy "Dieter's Dream".There's also some more obscure sketches that haven't gotten their due. "Philip" has got to be my favorite of the bunch. Myers is a hyper - hypo (he's hypglycemic and hyperactive) trying to win the affections of Nicole Kidman while strapped to a jungle gym in a harness. There's also a very funny sketch with him as an injured WWII soldier and Rob Schneider as Hitler. There's a lot more great moments.Some may complain that a few sketches are missing. I'm sure there are, but the ones here are very funny and will keep you on the edge of your seat with laughter. So pull up a chair, make some popcorn, and make every night SATURDAY NIGHT!!! </p>

 <p> While not as versatile as Dana Carvey or Phil Hartman, Mike Myers had his own comedic charm that made him one of "Saturday Night Live's" most popular castmembers in the early 1990s'. Unlike Carvey and Hartman, Myers was a sort of character actor, relying on his own comic creations rather than impressions. Many of those characters have gone to become some of the best - known in "SNL" history and revived it as a sketch - comedy show.Even if you don't consider this his absolute best, I find it pretty hard for anyone not to enjoy what's on here. Whether you like Wayne from "Wayne's World" or Dieter, host of the German television show "Sprockets", eveything here will make you laugh. Also, a wealth of unknown sketches are here. The "RAF" sketch with Rob Scneider as Adolf Hitler is funny if a little dated (literally dated - it takes place in 1943). "Philip" and "Lothar Of The Hill People" were two of the most controversial sketchs in the show's history. I didn't enjoy the latter sketch but the former is hysterical. The "Simon" sketch is also very funny. "Dieter's Dream" is an eerie sketch. It's easy to laugh at it (especially Phil Hartman's cameo and the "Electric Company" parody with the German nun), but you can't help but be a little freaked out by it. The "Coffee Talk" sketch features hilarous cameos by Madonna (who delightfully disses herself), RoseannEe Barr and Barbara Streisand. The Material Girl also pops up in "Wayne's Wolrd" in the infamous fanatsy sequence. It's quite gross but very funny to watch Wayne and Madonna tongue - kiss each other and to see Dana Carvey dressed in that balck outfit (the sequence is a parody of the controversial "Justify My Love" video). Also included are his hilarious impressions of Ron Wood and Mick Jagger.This is a very funny dvd. The extras aren't that great. I enjoyed "Wayne's World" immensely and "Judge Ito" was good to, but the rest didn't do much for me. Buy this for the hilarious regular sketches. Also get Dana Carvey and the other "best - off" collections. </p>

 <p> Mike Myers was on "Saturday Night Live" for six years. During that time, he provided the show with some of its greatest moments, including what may possibly the greatest "SNL" sketch of all time ("Wayne's World"). "Saturday Night Live - The Best Of Mike Myers" collects 16 of Myers' greatest moments and compacts them onto an 83 - minute dvd.All of Myers' msot popular ecurring charatcers are here - Wayne, Linda Richman, Dieter, Simon, Phillip (this sketch is so funny), etc. Also included are lesser known charcters like Middle - Aged Man and Kenneth Reese Evans from "Theatre Stories" (very funny segments). Two great impressions, Ron Wood and Mick Jagger, are represented and are extremely funny. Every sketch on this dvd is extremely funny, with the best ones being the "Wayne's World" bits.The extras are pretty good as well. The "Coffe Talk" and "Wayne's World" skits are the best bonus sketches. However, "Scottish Soccer Hooligan Weekly" and the "Lance Ito" sketches are not very funny (the first one is disgusting) and should have been replaced by either the "Theatre Stories" sketch with John Malkovich or an "All Things Scottish" sketch,Other than these minor complaints, this is a great dvd. Mike Myers is truly one of the greatest performers in the history of "Saturday Night Live" and without a doubt deserves all of the success he has achieved. </p>

 <p> For 6 years, Mike Myers remained one of &quot;Satturday Night Live's&quot; most versatile cast members, with his assortment of quirky characters and a few memorable impressions of British celebrites. So anyone would be hardpressed to choose 16 of Mike's best sketches to fit one dvd. Fotunatel, it was an easy task for the people at Broadwat Video, who have put together just about every &quot;SNL&quot; anthology. They sketches span from his first season in 1989 to the 1994 - 95 season, the season in which Myers left during the second half.All of Mike's classic characters are here. Wayne of &quot;Wayne's World&quot; is represented in 2 hilarius sketches, one in which he and Garth (Dana Carvey) are jamming with Aerosmith and another, more popular one in which they enjoy a &quot;wet dream involving Madonna. I also enjoyed some characters who only appeared once or twice or the ones who appeared many times but never became as popular, like Lothar, Simon, Philip and Middle - Aged Man. His passion for Britian pops more than one in the &quot;Hedley And Wyche&quot; toothpaste commercial, &quot;RAF Hospital&quot;, &quot;Simon&quot;, &quot;Theatre Stories&quot; and his hilarious impressions of Mick Jagger and Ron Wood. Linda Richman and Dieter are also here. I'm glad that his most popular characters are presented in complete sketches. Carvey and Sandler had to have their most memorable characters (Operaman and The Church Lady) butchered to mere montages on their dvds.The bonus sketches are okay. I especially enjoyed &quot;Wayen's World&quot; and &quot;Update Ito&quot;, bu the others weren't as good. Still, this is an excellent compilation of one of the greatest comedians of our time. Since leaving &quot;SNL&quot;, he hit it big as a movie star with &quot;Austin Powers&quot; and &quot;Shrek&quot;, but he hasn't forotten the show that made him famous. He hosted in 1997, appeared at the 25th anniversary special and made a cameo in last season's Alec Baldwin episode. </p>

 <p> I really don't know why this is called the bonus edition.  I think you find that many people are saying that these are'nt really the best sketches, but from my experience these Saturday Nigt Live Best of Series are not strictly comprehensive.  Mike Myers for instance has done so many high quality gut busting sketches that to take a sample of ten means that automatically many favorites don't make it.It is worth the dollars and cents though.  My name is Simon and I like to do drawings with Danny Devito, English play review with Mikey Rooney and Steve Martin, Dito and Sprockets, Nicole Kidman and the boy with the harness who can't have choclate, and some English toothpaste which is good on crackers, and ofcourse Coffe Talk with Roseanne Barr, Maddona and oh my gosh...Also Lothar of the Hill people and Mike as Mick from the Rolling Stones with Keith Richards played by the real Mick "Mick you ignorant [...]"Hey how can you go wrong with Mike Myers.  If you are looking for a cure all full line up of great sketches you will be disapointed but the DVD is a good apetizer portion. </p>

 <p> I used to own the VHS version of this, but threw it away when I realized that it had very few funny sketches on it.  I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that it just seems like they went for the sketches with the most famous people in them.  I saw the Coffee Talk sketch with Madonna and Roseanne and Barbra Streisand when it first aired; I didn't think it was funny then and I don't think it's funny now.  I found it totally boring.  I know there were better Coffee Talk segments.I found the Wayne's World segment with Tom Hanks and Aerosmith to be pretty boring and not very funny, ditto with the Danny DeVito episode of Simon.  The best episode of Simon that there ever was was the one with Macaulay Culkin, hands down.Lothar of the Hill People is one of the stupidest things I have ever had to sit through, and the thing with Ron Wood, Liam Neeson, and Nell was stupid also.I loved the Mick Jagger sketch and I think that Philip the Hyper-Hypo is hilarious.  I had a cousin who was sort of like Philip when I was growing up, and he used to come over and destroy everything in our house.The other one that almost made me soil myself the first time I saw it was the British play review with Steve Martin and Dana Carvey and (I think) Eric Idle.  That is one of my favorite single sketches in the history of SNL...the world--BANG! the wooorrrllld! </p>

 <p> I remember Mike Myers being in a lot of funny sketches, but they didn't seem to include many on this disk.  I really enjoyed the Wayne's World sketches, and Sprockets (although I would have like to see the one with Phil Hartman dressed as Heidi).  Theatre Stories was OK, and the Tokyo Game Show was on the Chris Farley DVD.  Most of the other sketches were pretty blah and I found myself reaching for the fast forward several times.  Philip (where he plays a hyperactive child) was surprisingly boring.  Middle Aged Man and Lothar were also pretty [bad].  I remember liking these on the show, but maybe my tastes have changed?  Maybe they just picked some of the [bad] sketches?Make sure you check out the extras -- there was a very funny Scottish Soccer fan sketch in there.Oh, I found that the menus on this disk were poorly done and took forever to navigate, at least on my DVD player. </p>

 <p> Not being American, I have never watched the show. So I was basing my expectations on films in which I have seen these comedians.It should be said perhaps that I am not a huge fan of stand-up comedy, I find it usually strained. But anyway, I am vaguely disappointed. I bought The Best Of Steve Martin and of Mike Meyers, and... well, while they are clearly both amongst our most talented comedians, I feel that the material on these DVDs is really not that damn good. I mean the writing, the sketches. Particularly considering that these are *best of* collections.I dunno... I guess you had to be there. </p>

 <p> This is the 4th SNL Best of that I have, the other 3 being of Will Ferrell vol. 1, Adam Sandler and Chris Farley. While my other 3 are classics that I adore, this one isn't at all as funny. I felt that there were some hilarious sketches but a lot of dull and uninteresting ones. ALL OF THE SKETCHES IN THE OTHER 3 BEST OF ROCK! But, in this one, only certain ones do. I still recommend buying it because you can't just buy a couple of them.In my opinion, the coffee talk, and Wayne's World ones weren't funny at all. But, there were some that I enjoyed. I don't know all of their specific names but here are my favorites:- The british toothpaste- Mike Myers and Nicole Kidman in a park, with Myers wearing a helmet and a harness (Hilarious!!!!!)- Crazy Japanese show with Chris Farley and Alec Baldwin- Donny's awful revelations (Hilarious)- Sprockets with DieterThose are the only ones that I liked but they are worth buying the DVD because they're hilarious and memorable. Even though not all of them are funny, 5 of them are. And that's worth the buy. Some good laughs. But if you had to choose between best of Chris Farley, Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler and Mike Myers, this is how I rank them.1. Chris Farley- all of them are hilarious! Matt Foley rocks!2. Will Ferrell- All of them are hialrious! More cowbell! Roxbury Guys! Harry Carrey!3. Adam Sandler- Most of them are hilarious! Some get old after a while! Opera Man! Canteen Boy!4. Mike Myers- Dome of them are hilarious while others aern't. Sprockets! </p>

 <p> I enjoyed the DVD in part.At least the makers of the DVD did not TOTALLY disappoint like they did with the first of the Best Of Will Ferrell DVD by leaving off his me memorable bits.In this one with Mike we get 2 of the famous "Wayne's World" bits Aerosmith and Tom Hanks together and Madonna.We get the famous "Coffee Talk" bit with Barbra, Madonna and Roseanne.Some bits I expected were not there.  BUT, as I stated above, about the Will Ferrell first DVD this one is not as bad as you have those memorable bits I commented on above.Not perfect but a good DVD. </p>

 <p> I agree with other reviewers who said this "Best of" video does not begin to include Myers' best stuff from SNL. Some of the editing choices are downright inexplicable.For example, one of Myers' funniest impersonations is of Ronnie Wood, which he did just three times on SNL. The first sketch was by far the best -- hysterical -- while the other two were pretty much forgettable.  So what are we given on this video?  You guessed it -- not the first.The exact same thing is true for Sprockets, Coffee Talk and most of his other classic characters and sketches.This video is very disappointing and is a perfect example of why NBC/Broadway Video should make COMPLETE SNL EPISODES (if not complete seasons) available for purchase. </p>

 <p> Popping up as a featured player in early 1989, Mike Myers quickly worked his way up the ranks to become one of the funniest & most talented performers on SNL. He soon dominated the SNL schedule with sketch favorites like Wayne's World & Sprockets.So why such a tepid collection of his work? Does this REALLY represent Myers at his best? Yes & no. The collection does include key moments on the show, but some of it feels like filler. Is the Japanese Game Show bit really that funny? More like loud & over-the-top. And seems like contestant Chris Farley stole the show here, not Myers.As someone who would go on to bigger movie fame, Myers deserves a better collection showcase. </p>

 <p> One of the difficulties of the &quot;Best of&quot; series is that someone else is deciding what's best.  This is no easy task with a performer who was on SNL as long as Mike Myers.  Distilling six years of performance to a  mere 16 sketches (20 if you get the DVD version) inevitably leaves the  serious fan unsatisfied.  To be sure, this effort gives us Myers' principle  characters, but they're not necessarily in their funniest sketches.  The  &quot;Coffee Talk&quot; on the tape is definitely not the funniest one he  ever did, though it is the one with the biggest stars in guest roles.  Likewise, there are funnier &quot;Sprockets&quot; and &quot;Simon&quot;  sketches-but the ones included have serious star power.  &quot;Best&quot;  in this case seems more often than not to mean &quot;the one where (insert  famous person's name here) was on the show&quot;.None of this to say  that this isn't a funny compilation.  It is.  The Wayne's World sketches  *are* probably the best efforts, and the others aren't dull by any  means.It just would be nice if Broadway Video did serious fans a favor  and used the storage capacity of the DVD format to create performer  anthologies.  I would rather have *all* the sketches of a particular  performer and be able to decide for myself which were the funniest.  At the  very least it would be nice to have the first of each major character's  appearances.  It would been even better to have some commentary by Mike  Myers and maybe the writing staff on how the characters came into being.  Now that the show has reached the mature age of 25, maybe Lorne Michaels  will produce a more behind-the-scenes, documentarized compilation series in  the future.Until then, the &quot;Best of&quot; series is a good enough  substitute.  On balance, however, this may be one of the few video products  that might be best bought on VHS instead of DVD.  Other than the few  additional sketches, many of which are drawn from Myers' return hosting of  the show and not his stint as featured player, there are no special  features on the DVD.  The extra sketches ARE funny, and the Judge Ito  Apology sketch marks the closest thing to an appearance of Austin Powers  SNL has witnessed.  But the question is whether these sketches alone  warrant the extra price, or whether you can own the VHS but rent the DVD  for one-time viewing. </p>
