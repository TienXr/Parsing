<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Once again, Amazon proves it is the place to go first. </p>

 <p> It was surprisingly inexpensive and  is working great. I have a wireless phone system with 2 phones so each got a new battery. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> worse than the old battery it replaced </p>

 <p> these things are horrible- at least the one's i got are.  I use the ATT phone with a magic jack plus. Sometimes for work, i have phone calls that can last upwards of 6 hours.  I was starting to notice that the old battery just wasn't able to make it through some the marathon calls. I bought these as a replacement and a spare.  I did my best to condition the new battery before heavy use. I tried to let it charge over night and then i tried to discharge it fully.  But i can barely get two hours of talk time out it after several weeks of use.Buyer Beware! </p>

 <p> great batteries for the price </p>

 <p> What else can I say? The batteries were great. I usually have to replace them once every year or two but $5.00 a pop is way cheaper than a new phone system (That's what I paid for them anyway).The rating says 850mah but I charged them for the first time on a digital charger I use for my radio controlled plane batteries. THe batteries actually charge to a little over 950 mah which is very good.I expect to see these last at least 18 months before they need replacing once again. </p>

 <p> I needed new batteries for my AT&T cordless phone and the only place I could find them at a reasonable price was Amazon.com. So far so good these new batteries are holding up just fine. Thank you Amazon. </p>

 <p> I purchased these replacement batteries for my VTEC DET 6.0 phones based on the part number and the picture. Once i received the items I immediately noticed that they were not the original replacement like what is being advetise.I however placed them in my phones as the original died, they are working thus far but the are definitely not the original that the phone came with or the picture being shown. </p>

 <p> These batteries are fantastic!  Didn't take long to fully charge.  They hold a charge well and anything is better than the original batteries that came with our home phone.  Great price and product! </p>

 <p> I like these batteries I purchased. My house phones were dead for a very long time because I could not find batteries that were compatible. I purchased some from radio shack that pretty much cost me $60, but they didn't work at all. I was assured they were the only ones suitable for AT&T DIGITAL 5.0 phones. None of the electronic dept. at any store outlet had them. After finally deciding to check out Amazon. I found the exact model battery for 2 only 1/12th of the cost. I've used them for 3weeks now and I am totally pleased with my purchase. I cotinually recommend my fam & friends to check out amazon now. </p>

 <p> Although it carries the identical type number, the dimensions of the shipped product are slightly smaller than the battery it replaced. As a result, the battery rattles and the phone now feels like there is a loose component inside. No big deal though unless you vigorously shake the phone. The performance of the battery is good. </p>

 <p> I replaced the battery on two of my cordless phones and couldn't be happier. They shipped very fast in a plain bag that was easy to open. They hooked up with no problems and charged as listed, I would order from this store again with no exceptions to replace any of my phone batteries.... </p>
