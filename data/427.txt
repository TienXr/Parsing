 <p> Took this character three books to have growth and then the book ended. I was disappointed in that but when you look at the book pages. I believe this is one book that was split in three pieces so then the growth maybe on target. I did pay what I would a popular author with the last two book prices. But it is done and it did hold my interest enough for me to want to purchase. But... would I recommend it.. NO! </p>

 <p> When I finished book 2 in the series, I couldn't stand not knowing what happened next, so I immediately ordered it thanks to Kindle. I read the book in two days and then ordered book 4 while in the hospital, after major surgery. I haven't been able to read it yet, but will as soon as the doctor releases me to do things I enjoy.Everyone who enjoys a good vampire story with a twist will fall in love with this series. It lets you ask the questions are our lives ruled by fate or can we change them? Have we lived previous lives? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Another excellent book in the Vampire with series.  As with all the others, parts of this book are extremely weird and hard to visualize, but then wouldn't dealing with witches or vampires be exactly that, and would you really trust them.  I enjoy the setting of these books in New Orleans, the city that holds appeal for the paranormal.  If this would happen anywhere it would be New Orleans.  The characters have changed throughout the series as they delve more deeply into the darkness that is vampire and witch.  A trip through the Louisiana swamp was sinister, as I think it would be.  This book is definitely a good escape from every day life. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great story line! </p>

 <p> I read all three (3) books: #1The Den, #2 In the Blood and #3The Seventh Day.  The story line kept your attention and it was hard to put the book down.  Once you finish with one of the books you have a desperate need to get the next book in the series to continue on with the story.  I am waiting for book #4 to be released to continue enjoying the characters and story line in the book.  I enjoy vampire books and would recommend this series. The down side is waiting for the next book. </p>
