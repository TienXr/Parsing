<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> WWE Tag Team Champions Big Show & Miz VS Mark Henry & MVP: A decent opener, nothing different from what you'd watch on Raw or Smackdown.WWE US Champion Kofi Kingston VS The Miz: I hate the Miz & the US title is a meaningless belt. This is like the opener-good match but nothing different from Raw or Smackdown.DX VS Legacy in Submissions Count Anywhere: A long, mostly boring match where DX puts over Legacy. Yes, Triple H actually put someone over-well HBK submitted not him.Singapore Cane Match: Kane VS Great Khali: After viewing this PPV, it's sad to say this was probably my favorite match on the card. A fan chanted boring towards the end & Khali's manager interferes for no reason. Kane wins with an impressive choke slam.ECW Champion Christian VS William Regal: A good match that was slow in spots. Regal looked really good in some spots but Christian retains in the end.WWE Champion John Cena VS Randy Orton: Respect Cena, despise Orton. I watched this PPV 4 years after this event occured & these two are still feuding over the belt & they wonder why they cant attract new fans. Yawn.World Champion CM Punk VS Undertaker: A very short match that never got off the ground. Undertaker wins in the end & the crowd seems dead (no pun intended) as Teddy Long comes out & says Taker's submission was banned so the match restarts. Punk clips the knee, locks in an Anaconda vice, & the bell is rung. BS, pure & utter BS. Long looks on as Punk runs off & Taker is mad.Overall, I hate WWE PG. None of the matches really stood out as must watch classics & it's pretty much the same old routine. I'd avoid this PPV unless you're a completist. </p>

 <p> Who Has Reached Their Breaking Point? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The traditional September PPV of Unforgiven was replaced this year by a new concept where it was all about making someone submit by pushing someone past their limit to their "Breaking Point."Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Big Show vs. M.V.P. & Mark Henry - The opening match was contested between two similar teams.  Both weren't established as a long term tag team and both teams contested of one individual who was the speed & more agile wrestler while the other was the bigger & strong member of the team and you saw that similarites in this match as the match really picked up whenever Jericho & M.V.P. were in the ring while it was more of a slower power style whenever Henry & Show were in the ring.  It was a solid opening tag team match.United States Champion Kofi Kingston vs. The Miz - When you take into concideration how both men have been used all year with the Miz being a comedy act for weeks after months of buildup going to waste by being buried by John Cena while Kofi constantly being an uneventful champion booked in last minute multiman matches...this was the shock of the night for just how good this match was.  It started off slow but picked up over time with the crowd getting into it as both men kept pulling out counter after counter for various moves.  This was definately a "sleeper" match that was way better than you expected it to be going in.Submissions Count Anywhere Match: D-Generation X vs. The Legacy - This is the first of 3 different types of submission matches throughout the night with a special type of twist on a normal "falls count anywhere" match as for those who know their WWE history in regards to the city of Montreal, you'll get a laugh out of DX's introduction.  As you expect in this match, more of the action happened outside of the ring than it did in the ring as they fought through the crowd, ringside, near the stage, backstage.  Along with the normal submission moves you've seen in the past from DX like a figure four & even the crossface, you saw various unique types of submission moves both teams like Shawn doing a reverse dragon sleeper using the handrail in the isleway, DX using a boston crab/camel clutch combination, a variation of the Gory Guerrero backbreaker, and even Ted doing his dad's famous "Million $ Dream".  This was the type of match that an unestablished team like Legacy NEED as they divived & conquered here resulting in them doing something that no other team before them as ever done.Singapore Cane Match: Kane vs. Great Khali - Kane is in a match that was named after him (get it...Kane & cane?).  Alright, I know that was a bad joke but that was more entertaining than this match itself as these two just don't work well together with Kane only being as good as the person across from him while Khali just isn't good unless he's with a small guy who knows how to bounce around & be a personal spot monkey for him & the canes hurt more (as if that's possible) than it helped here.  Sorry for the rant but whoever seriously thinks that these two facing each other are an attraction that people want to see needs to be fired.ECW Champion Christian vs. William Regal - This match was exactly what you expected it to be in that it was a technical matbased match between two heavily underrated competitors with Regal showing signs of his old WCW "Lord Steven Regal" character with some of those knee shots he delivered.  Similar to the earlier match with Kofi/Miz, the crowd got more into it over time as we got the match here that we should have gotten at SummerSlam.Right around here was a segment featuring WWE Hall Of Famer, the first Intercontinental Champion, and Montreal's own Pat Patterson & the #1 contendor for the I.C. Title in Dolph Ziggler that just wasn't funny or entertaining at all."I Quit" Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. John Cena - Due to what happened at SummerSlam, the stipulation here was that Orton will lose the title if anyone get involved.  This is one of those matches that's more about "putting over a character" more than actual wrestling quality because the actual physical part of the match itself (haven't seen their matches past this PPV) ranks below their previous two SummerSlam matches but above their other two PPV matches that were also setup to just further a storyline.  This match heavily showcased Orton's "Viper" character as being cold hearted & calculating & merciless by just attacking Cena's head with the hanging DDT and weapons like a monitor & steel chair & the steps.  Orton also at one point had Cena handcuffed and just beating the hell out of him & so obsessed with having Cena say "I Quit" that he even refused to allow Cena to "get out easy" & passout from the pain while Cena's character was pushed here too as he just kept taking a beating but refused to quit.  I'll give credit in that I thought it was a creative way of applying the STF but the finish just came too quick to be believeable.  In the end, you have to look at this match for what it was in that it was more of a "character driven" match more than anything else.Submission Match: World Champion C.M. Punk vs. Undertaker - This is one of those matches that was good for what it was but it should have been better.  Taker & Punk started off well with both men going back & forth with Punk heavily relying on his kicks against Taker here but as soon as the match was starting to develop, it was suddenly cut short with the screwjob ending involving the referee, Punk, and Theodore Long that left the crowd with no reaction more than anything else.  This wasn't a good way to end the show.DVD extras include highlights of former "Price Is Right" host Bob Barker hosting RAW along with a post match interview with Chris Jericho & Big Show.  In the end, this is one of those average shows where it wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't a memorable show itself.  There was just as much bad (Punk/Taker & Kane/Khali & that Ziggler segment) as there was good (DX/Legacy & Kofi/Miz & Regal/Christian) while the rest of the matches were either solid or average but nothing to really brag out.  So if you have a couple of spare bucks that you won't miss, go ahead & pick this up but it's nothing to go out of your way to see. </p>

 <p> Unified WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Chris Jericho and The Big Show (Champions) vs. Mark Henry and MVPA nice opener, but I expected more out of it. There was back-and-forth action throughout the entire match, though Jericho mostly got dominated by MVP and Mark Henry. MVP hit Ball'n and even countered a Walls of Jericho attempt. Big Show and Mark Henry started battling one another, with Henry catching a splash attempt in the corner by Big Show, which was pretty astonishing. Henry then worked over Jericho, hitting a splash on him, but he couldn't get the win because Jericho got his foot on the rope. MVP and Big Show started brawling on the outside of the ring. Jericho went for the Codebreaker, but Henry caught him and tossed him over his head! Big Show climbed up on the apron and laid Henry out with the Knockout Punch. Jericho covered and won the match, retaining the titles. That ending is getting old...Winners: Chris Jericho and The Big Show. Match Rating: 4/5United States Championship Match: Kofi Kingston (Champion) vs. The MizYeah, these two are going to be main eventers pretty soon. Kingston and Miz went back-and-forth the entire match, with Miz hitting some awesome counters. He hit a big boot on Kofi went Kofi went for a crossbody, and he also countered the Boom Drop by getting his knees up! Miz's Skull Crushing Finale was countered by Kofi though, but Miz ducked the Trouble in Paradise. They went back and forth like this for a while, and there were a ton of near-falls. Kofi hit some unique offensive maneuvers and Miz hit a neckbreaker/reverse DDT combination. Miz event hit the Reality Check, but Kofi STILL kicked out! Kingston later hit the Boom Drop, but Miz kicked out! Miz went for the Skull Crushing Finale again, but Kofi pushed him away, bounced him off the ropes, and hit the Trouble in Paradise to end the match! Winner: Kofi Kingston. Match Rating: 5/5Submissions Count Anywhere Match: D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) vs. Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase)This was just brutal, plain and simple. Triple H and Shawn Michaels started out with the early advantage, focusing on the legs of Rhodes and DiBiase. They used everything around the ring to soften up their opponents (Triple H and Shawn Michaels set Cody Rhodes up in a chair and then applied a Sharpshooter and Camel Clutch SIMULTANEOUSLY), and then the fight spilled into the crowd, and then to the concession stands. There, Triple H and Shawn Michaels locked in a Figure Four Leglock onto both Legacy members, but Legacy fought back. Legacy then had the advantage as the match made its way back down to the arena. They then fought by the stage area, with Rhodes knocking Michaels off the fan railing and onto a set of tables!!! Rhodes and DiBiase then brawled with Triple H to the backstage area, where Triple H fought back by powering out of the Million Dollar Dream and hitting a big Spinebuster on DiBiase through a table!!! Triple H then applied the Crossface onto Rhodes, but DiBiase recovered and smacked Triple H in the head with a cooler! He threw the cooler on Triple H's head, and then Rhodes hit a Conchairto on Triple H, with the concrete as the other chair!!! Rhodes and DiBiase then double-teamed Michaels in the ring, with Michaels fighting back by laying Rhodes out with the Sweet Chin Music, but his efforts were futile. Rhodes locked in the Figure Four Leglock using the steel ring post while DiBiase simultaneously applied the Million Dollar Dream, giving Michaels no choice but to tap out. Winners: Legacy. Match Rating: 5/5Singapore Cane Match: Kane vs. The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh)This match was a big step up from their SummerSlam encounter. They both used the canes viciously, with plenty of rib and head shots throughout. Khali hit multiple chops to Kane's head, but Kane powered out of the Punjabi Plunge by smacking a cane on Khali's arm. Ranjin Singh attacked Kane when Kane went for the Chokeslam on Khali, so Kane laid him out. Khali went for the Vice Grip, but Kane dodged the move and hit his signature flying clothesline, using the cane instead! Kane then laid Khali out with a breathtaking Chokeslam to win the match! Winner: Kane. Match Rating: 4/5ECW Championship Match: Christian (Champion) vs. William RegalThis was a pretty decent match, but they could've done better. Regal was brutal in his assault on Christian, though Christian hit Regal with some pretty stiff shots. Christian's attempts at the Killswitch were repeatedly countered, though Regal's attempts to hit the Knee Trembler and apply the Regal Stretch were also countered. Regal event went for the Knee Trembler while Christian was lying on the apron, but he ended up missing. Christian took a nasty bump to the outside at one point, and it seemed like all was over. That was until Regal missed the Knee Trembler and Christian laid him out with the KillSwitch to retain his title.Winner: Christian. Match Rating: 4/5Special Stipulations "I Quit" Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. John CenaThe special stiuplation was that if anyone interferred on Orton's behalf, he would automatically forfeit the title. This match was BRUTAL. Orton dominated the early portion, laying Cena out with a steel chair. Though when Orton went for an RKO on the chair, Cena fought back with his usual offense. Orton managed to counter an Attitude Adjustment attempt, and he also fought out of the STF at one point. Orton then got some handcuffs out and handcuffed Cena to the ropes. Orton then basically tortured Cena, SMASHING the Singapore canes from earlier onto Cena's ribs and head. Orton also used the steel chair, and even stomped on Cena's head while it was laid out on the steel steps, but Cena refused to quit! Cena fought back by kicking Orton in the groin and then getting out of the handcuffs by grabbing the key from Orton. Cena fought back in the ring with his usual offense, and then handcuffed Randy Orton. Cena applied the STF while pulling back on the handcuff chain on Orton to make Orton quit! Winner: John Cena. Match Rating: 5/5Submission World Heavyweight Championship Match: CM Punk (Champion) vs. The UndertakerAnother awesome match and an amazing main event. Undertaker beat the crap out of Punk for the early going, though Punk fought back by countering some of Undertaker's moves. On the outside, Punk smashed a steel chair on Undertaker's head twice to soften him up. In the ring though, Punk's attempts at his signature offense were countered. Undertaker went for a Chokeslam, but Punk powered out of the move. Punk laid Undertaker out, but Undertaker applied the Hell's Gates out of nowhere! Punk tapped...but Teddy Long appeared and reminded them that the move was banned from SmackDown! back when Vickie Guerrero was General Manager, thus restarting the match! Punk went back in the ring, but Undertaker fought back and went for the Last Ride! Punk managed to counter the move and knock Undertaker down. He applied the Anaconda Vice, and the referee called for the bell, with Undertaker never even tapping out! Winner: CM Punk. Match Rating: 5/5OVERALL EVENTAmazing...I haven't seen a pay-per-view this good for a LONG time. EVERY single match on the card was good. EVERY SINGLE MATCH. There wasn't a bad apple to be seen. There was a lot of hardcore wrestling and a lot of technical wrestling, as well as some high-flying stuff. The segment with Dolph Ziggler beating up Pat Patterson was a little lame, but besides that, the show was quite good. CM Punk beating the crap out of Jimmy Wang Yang in the locker room was pretty funny, and the "screwjob" at the end of the pay-per-view, while not a very big surprise, still got me offguard. This has the potential of being PPV of the year! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A Night Of Submissions & Screwjobs </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Once again, thanks to WWE Classics On Demand, I was able to see WWE's new concept PPV that replaced the annual Unforgiven card with this event being named Breaking Point in which all of the main event matches need to end by someone submitting.Unified Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho & Big Show vs M.V.P. & Mark Henry. As I have mentioned before, I am not really big on the whole "Jeri-Show" tag team while I can care less about the M.V.P./Henry duo. Although, I am happy to say that this was a good opener that the crowd actually got into with the action getting better when Jericho took on M.V.P. while the action slowed when Show was working with Henry.United States Champion Kofi Kingston vs The Miz. This was one of those matches that was better than what it looked on paper as the action was getting better as time went on with both men doing counter after counter to the point that the crowd made no noise at the start but slowly got into the action. Definitely the "sleeper" match of the night & both men's best match up to this point.Submissions Count Anywhere: D-Generation X vs Legacy. Before the match, there was some comedy as the crowd quickly cheered but then turned in the "You Screwed Bret" chants towards Shawn Michaels (they are in Montreal) with Triple H pulling off the quick one-liner that had everyone laughing. Anyways, this was a brawl that went all over the building with moments of both teams using innovative submission attempts like the camel clutch & boston crab on a folded chair by DX, Cody doing the Gory Guerrero special, the double figure four in the aisle way before Legacy was able to take out Triple H & dominate HBK in the ring including the finishing move of the figure four around the ringpost combined with the million dollar dream. This was my favorite match of the night as Legacy got the biggest win in their young careers while both teams still left the match strong.Singapore Cane Match: Kane vs The Great Khali. Honestly, I just fast-forward this match since these two just don't work well together & who ever made this feud needs to get shot.ECW Champion Christian vs William Regal. Now, this was the match that we should have gotten at SummerSlam as this was a great mat-based wrestling match with Regal actually being able to control the action at times including using some of his stiff offense including one knee to the face to Christian that it had everyone in the arena turn their heads. We all know the type of performance Christian can deliver & just like the previous title match, the crowd got into the action as time went on as this was again, another great match.I-Quit Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs John Cena. If you can get pass the whole predictable finish (I honestly saw it coming from a mile away) including the quick STF finish, this match told a good story of how Orton was just punishing Cena throughout the match to the point where his offense was calculating just to make Cena suffer with one moment to point out being Cena being handcuffed to the ringpost, only to be beaten with a singapore cane. Again, a good story told but this was no where near their SummerSlam clash from the month prior.Submission Match: World Champion CM Punk vs The Undertaker. This was a real disappointment as this match ended just when it was starting to pick up and become really good. Both men worked well together in the short time that they had but this was all about setting up another "Screwjob" in Montreal as Taker won the match originally but then had the decision reverse that lead to Theodore Long & the referee pulling off something that we have seen before. A bad way to end the night as I actually enjoyed their Hell In A Cell match a month later more than this.Overall, this event had three matches worth checking out in DX/Legacy, Kofi/Miz & Christian/Regal while the rest was either watchable or just bad so hopefully this was the first & only time WWE will use this concept because it really did hurt the event more than helped. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Well, personally I think that this PPV should be called Deciding Point, because of the outcome in the fate of the world match between the two Hannons.  In case you missed it those two goons just went to the ring and told the crowd that they would rule the world together whilst eating pizza and drinking some A&W in their living room.  As for this PPV they are going to put forth matches between some of their loyal subjects in order to determine mankind's fate.  It should be noted that the Hannons will be eating pizza during this event as well.  Anyway, I think that this PPV might be good, but then again, maybe it won't.  Either way, we will be forced to withstand some classic Hannon shortcomings in the near future.  Good luck to all. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I'll get right to the reviews and give some final thoughts at the end.Tag TitlesJerishow vs MVP & Mark HenryStandard tag opener.  Very similiar to all the other Jerishow vs (insert team here) matches we have had on RAW and different pay per views over the past few months.  Simply a par match.  5/10United States TitleKofi Kingston vs the MizMiz and Kofi seemed to have trouble combining their styles and coming together at the beginning of this one.  The action picks up toward the end and they seemed to find their step.  6/10Submissions Count AnywhereDX vs LegacyI love this feud.  I loved their match at the previous pay per view, Summerslam.  I simply liked this match.  The entire first half the match of basically a wild punch brawl though the entire arena.  When the second half rolls around, they begin to focus on putting together a little bit better of a match with a little psychology/story telling - yet still keep with the arena brawl theme.  I think the good feud and storytelling helped keep me into this one - and subsequently helped keep my rating as high as it was.  7/10Singapore Cane MatchKane vs KhaliWhile this is by no means a good match - it is an improvement over their match from Summerslam.  The cane gimmick obviously helped.  Not a bad ending....it at least gave the crowd a reason to stop booing.  4.5/10ECW ChampionshipChristian vs William RegalAnother solid bout on the card.  Regal has some really great offense and he showcased alot of it here.  Christian always seems to shine with talent, to me, on pay per views.  Could have been really something special if they had more time and ability to really go all out.  7/10WWE Championship"I Quit" MatchI enjoyed this one.  They kept with the same theme of Summerslam - they were going to do something different/creative/tell a story with it.  The end result was once again a solid match at Breaking Point.  Match became a little methodical and slow at points, but Randy's character and motives kept you involved in it.  The ending came a little abrupt for me.  I would have liked it to have been somewhat more climactic.  7/10World Heavyweight TitleSubmission MatchCM Punk vs UndertakerI really loved the way this match started out.  I felt like it was going to be a great encounter, the likes of which we had not seen in a long time.  I liked the way CM Punk showed zero fear to the Undertaker and it return that served only to anger the Undertaker.  CM Punk kept up with the Undertaker and seemed to stay a step ahead of him at times.  This one was going great when we were given an out of no where ending - followed by another out of no where ending.  It was going so great and it ended up really disappointing me.  7/10 (only because I loved how it was shaping up to be before the 9 minute end mark)As you can see, alot of things were rated 7/10.  There were so many solid matches, but they all left something to be desired.  Everything could have been kick up a notch.  Some matches should have had more time.  It just left me feeling like I needed more out of all the big matches. </p>

<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> It's pretty obvious already that this show is getting mixed reviews.  Personally, I stand somewhere in the middle.  I did not think it was horrible, or even close to being WWE's worst ppv effort of the year.  That being said, there was really nothing on the show that warrants a purchase.  I feel that WWE really handcuffed themselves (no pun intended, see "I Quit Match") by holding a ppv with every main event as a submission match, because it really limits potential outcomes.  For instance, in the main event, they clearly realized that it was too soon to take the belt off of CM Punk, but they were so clueless as to how to have him retain without having Undertaker submit, that they rehashed the Montreal Screwjob, which happened 12 years ago.  Anyway, WWE should never hold this event again.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).1. WWE Tag Team Championship MatchChris Jericho (c) & Big Show (c) vs. MVP & Mark HenryDecent opener.  Match was not good when either Henry or Show were in it, but Jericho and MVP worked together nicely and made up for it.  Nothing to go out of your way and see, but this was a perfectly fine wrestling match. "Jerishow" go over clean after Show KOs Henry.  **1/42. WWE United States Championship MatchKofi Kingston (c) vs. the MizCrowd wasn't really into it, but they had a good match.  Lots of nearfalls and the finish was well executed. Both guys worked hard and they had the crowd pretty into it by the end.  Kofi wins clean with the Trouble in Paradise.  ***1/43. Submissions Count Anywhere MatchShawn Michaels & Triple H vs. Cody Rhodes & Ted DibiaseLong match and very sloppy in spots.  Crowd booed HBK, being as the event was being held in Montreal, and really wasn't all that into DX for much of the match, and it made this feel like it dragged.  They brawled all over the arena and it just went on and on and on.  There were some innovative spots and everyone worked hard, but this just wasn't that good.  Problem was, nobody involved really had a submission move that was over, so the crowd was pretty dead when, say, Cody Rhodes put an ankle lock on Shawn Michaels.  At least DX put over Legacy.  **1/44. Singapore Cane MatchGreat Khali vs. KaneI didn't think it possible, but they had an even worse match than their previous encounter at SummerSlam.  An abortion of a match, utterly shocking to behold.  -**5. ECW Championship MatchChristian (c) vs. William RegalVery solid pro wrestling match.  Crowd wasn't into it but it's understandible after what they had just witnessed.  Very technical match, and the crowd did get into by the end when Christian started making his comeback.  Christian pins Regal clean as a sheet with the Killswitch.  **3/46. WWE Championship "I Quit" MatchRandy Orton (c) vs. John CenaThe psychology and storytelling of this match was really excellent.  Most of the match revolved around handcuffs, with Orton cuffing Cena and just beating the hell out of him, but Cena kept refusing to quit.  Orton took most of the match, but it was Cena who eventually turned the tide and Orton quit after an STF.  As tired as Cena's unstoppable Hogan gimmick is, and as much as I don't like him as champion, I thought this was a very good match.  And seriously, did anyone think Cena was going to quit?  For me, the outcome was never in question because of the stips, but I'll give credit where credit is due.  ***3/47. World Heavyweight Championship Submission MatchCM Punk (c) vs. UndertakerThey were strapped for time by this point, so they only got about 8 minutes.  That being said, the match was good while it lasted but the ending came rather abruptly.  Undertaker submitted Punk with the Hell's Gate, but Teddy Long came out and reminded everyone that Vickie Guererro's ban of that hold was still in effect, and therefore the match was restarted.  Punk quickly applied the Anaconda Vice, but as he did so the ref immediately rang the bell.  So yes, it was the Montreal Screwjob in 2009.  Teddy Long looked morose and stood next to a jovial Punk as the show went off the air.  **1/2While this was an interesting show, this concept should never again be used by WWE.  The nature of the stipulations were such that WWE booked themselves into a corner, and had to resort to 12 year old tricks to get the outcomes that they wanted.  There was definately a mix of good and bad on the show, and I don't think one really outweighed the other, but when you look at this ppv as a whole, it is not worth your money.  Rent it if nothing else. </p>
