 <p> Since 1926, "Winnie-the-Pooh" has been a staple in American pop culture as a family friendly character and stories that many children for generations have grown up with.  And adults who have continued to share that with their own children.Just in time for Halloween, the popular characters from 100 Acre Wood such as Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit, Lumpy the Heffalump and Roo return in a family film for Halloween.In the film, Lumpy (the elephant) has never experienced Halloween ever.  But wants to experience the excitement that his friend have, especially taking part in "trick or treat".  But curious as he was to take part in it, he also becomes fearful after  Tigger's "Gobloon" story that if you are caught by one, one will turn into a jaggedy lantern.A bit frightened, Lumpy fortunately has the help of his good friend Roo to accompany him during Halloween.  But what happens when both become separated during Halloween?The 2005 Winnie the Pooh film "Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie" gets its re-release on DVD but this time around, a limited edition Winnie the Pooh disguised as Tigger plush is offered.VIDEO & AUDIO:Video is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 169 televisions.  Animation is quite nice for this film, featuring vibrant colors of the characters and 100 Acre Woods but also nicely painted backgrounds.  There is nothing dark or sinister, but you see the occasional bats and leafless forest that may look spooky.  It's important to note that the animation is hand-drawn and not 3D like recently released Winnie the Pooh animated films.Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (including French and Spanish language).  For the part, this film is dialogue driven and is clear and understandable (Note: Some children who are not familiar with British accents may have a hard time understanding Lumpy, as my six-year-old commented during the film, "does the elephant have a stuffy nose").Home theaters owners will mostly notice the film to be more front and center channel driven with the occasional bats screeching and leaves floating in the wind once in awhile utilized in the soundtrack.  Music is a big part of the film as background music is played during the background and at times, a few of the characters sing a song through the film.SPECIAL FEATURES:"Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie Limited Edition DVD Gift Set" comes with a stuff animal of Winnie the Pooh wearing a Tigger outfit and the following special features (games and DVD-Rom content):* Fun Games - Trick or Re-Treat - Roo has a hole in his trick or treat bag and lost his candy.  But with a map, you can help Roo find his lost candy.  Using your remote, you can help move Roo and Lumpy in a maze like map.  Featuring audio during the game.* Fun Games - Pooh's Boo Bingo! - The characters of 100 Acre Wood love playing Halloween games and that includes Boo Bingo!  Using your remote control, you can play bingo.  (note: printable cards are included and accessed via DVD-Rom on a PC or Mac).* Fun Games - Pass the Pumpkin - Similar to musical chairs, in this game (playing with friends), using your remote, one must pass the pumpkin.  When the music stops, those stuck with the pumpkin loses.* Heffalump Halloween Party Planner - If you play the DVD on a PC (or Mac), you can access a printable party planner.  Included are Printable party invitations, Halloween Bingo cards for Pooh's Boo Bingo, Halloween-themed recipes and decorating a jaggedy lantern.JUDGMENT CALL:The entertaining and family fun Winnie the Pooh Halloween film (from 2005) gets its re-release just in time for Halloween."Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie Limited Edition DVD Gift Set" is a family fun DVD featuring Winnie the Pooh and gang.  Can children of all ages watch the film, I would say yes.  But parents who are cautious about images of bats in animated format, aside from Tigger's (not-so-scary story), it depends on how a younger toddler may react to it but for the most part, the film is light-hearted at best.Of course, one of the biggest differences versus the 2005 release is the amount of games and DVD-Rom materials, so children can take part in the many games included.  As well, as parents who can access a party planner and recipes.For the limited edition DVD gift set, I have to admit that the Winnie the Pooh disguised as Tigger plush is one of the coolest Pooh plushes that I have ever seen (the Tigger hood can be removed as well).As a father, I have grown up with Winnie the Pooh long ago and when my son was born, he grew up with the character as well.  Now that he is six-years-old, it's great to find a children's Halloween animated story (aside from the Peanuts/Charlie Brown special) and DVD with special features that both parents and children can take part in together.  The games are games that children can learn from and are games that are part of Disney DVD's "Imagine, Laugh & Learn".Overall, "Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie Limited Edition DVD Gift Set" is an enjoyable and family fun-tastic Winnie the Pooh DVD release from Disney and definitely a gift set worth purchasing! </p>

 <p> We were so excited to get this for our 2 year old because he LOVES the other Pooh movie with Lumpy in it. So when it arrived, we sat down as a family and watched it. My husband and I were both kind of confused. It is so different than the tone of the other movie. The whole tone of this movie was sad and scared. There was nothing fun loving in it at all. Lumpy doesn't want to celebrate because everything scares him... so he shivers, whimpers, and cries over EVERYTHING, ALL THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. It was depressing lol. Our little boy did not enjoy it. He didn't smile once, he just looked concerned the whole time and after a while just wanted us to turn it off. We were really bummed, I don't think we will be watching this one again. </p>

 <p> "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" was a great feature introducing a cool new character, Lumpy, so it was probably inevitable that something like this would come out. But is this a direct-to-DVD Halloween treat or a trick?It would certainly seem that they're up to some of their old tricks by editing the contents of "Boo to You Too, Winnie the Pooh" into the movie as a story told by Roo to Lumpy to help him feel brave. However, it really isn't too bad and I had never seen it before. It also has Gopher in it, who you don't usually see anymore.Overall, I'd say that it's more of a treat than a trick. The movie starts out with Roo and Lumpy joining up for Lumpy's first Halloween and trick-or-treating experience. They head over to Piglet's house, where Rabbit is being his usual self --- trying to meticulously plan the whole thing out and being a bit of a pain in the process. (Fortunately, this segment is mercifully short.) They try to get Lumpy psyched for Halloween, but end up scaring the poor little heffalump so much that he ends up hiding under the bed. The last straw is Tigger's tale about a "gobloon" --- a ferocious creature who will turn you into a "jaggedy lantern" if it catches you --- but you get to make a wish if you catch it first. Tigger swears it's true, but Rabbit calls him a "lunatic." (Ouch!) They unsuccessfully attempt to pull Lumpy out and in all the chaos, Pooh Bear ends up eating all the Halloween candy. Lumpy finally comes out and he and Roo get the idea to find the Gobloon so that they can get more candy. Lumpy's still scared though, but he and Roo vow to be "brave together and brave forever." A series of incidents separate them, causing Roo to reevaluate whether candy is really even all that important.I do think that this has some important ideas on friendship and is generally a good film. The vocal performances for the songs aren't really quite as up to snuff as the original "Heffalump Movie," although the instrumental score is great! If you and/or your kids liked the original "Pooh's Heffalump Movie," I'd say to at least give this a shot. I'd wager it's odds-on you'll either really like it or really hate it (like some here) or just overall consider it maybe just slightly above-average like me.Here's the scoop on the (generally disappointing) special features on this DVD:Trick or Re-TreatWell, I thought this game had potential --- the name is certainly kinda clever. The idea of this game is that Roo has lost candy from his trick-or-treat bag and you have to retrace the path to help find it. First, you use the arrow keys on the remote control to follow the path and once you've reached an area where he's lost candy, you search behind the objects on the screen until you find it. The problem is that the path is totally unintuitive. It says that there are obstacles and pitfalls, but really it seems like you're just hopping around at random. Ultimately, it's not too hard to figure out, but it ends up being pretty lame.Pooh's Boo! BingoThis is definitely the best game on DVD. You start up the game and the DVD generates bingo numbers. Once somebody has bingo, they call out "Boo! Bingo" and you hit button and it plays a congratulation scene. Then, you can start over. Disadvantages --- if you don't have DVD-ROM, you can't print the provided bingo cards. Also, this isn't really a game that can be played alone --- you'll want at least two people, probably more.Pass the PumpkinWell, this one is all right. Basically, this is just a variation on your standard "hot potato, cold potato," except you get a pumpkin, get some people together in a circle (so again, definitely not something you can play by yourself) and pass it around. The DVD plays music for a period of time and when it stops, whoever's holding the pumpkin is out and it continues until the music stops. Once again, once you get a winner, you can play a congratulation screen.Heffalump Halloween Party PlannerHas ideas on how to set up a Halloween party and tips for using the DVD games and printable material as part of party. The printable material includes the bingo cards, cut-outs for pumpkin decorating, recipes and party invitations. </p>

 <p> Another cute Winnie The Pooh movie for your Collection!  My best friend's youngest ones are at the age where they just love Pooh and all his Pals, and lately they are especially in love with the Heffalump.  I sent them this one along with a few others for Easter....the only complaint I've heard is from their Mom who says &#34;Morning, Noon & Night, it's Poohmania around here...and that's great, but I'm afraid they're going to wear out the DVD's at the rate they're going!&#34;  Can't beat that for a positive review!  :) </p>

 <p> This is an awesome movie for small children.  My two year old loves this movie, he watches it almost every day.  Who really cares if its a rip off of another pooh movie?  If my son likes it thats what really matters to me.  I doubt any of the kids care, they probably love that part so its a good thing its in there.  I think its a sweet story and a great movie for halloween. </p>

 <p> My two year old loves this movie. He loved it the first time he saw it. I will say that we misplaced it and so we did not see it for a while (3wks) and after we found it he was initially a little jumpy about the intro. However, once he was over that he was laughing and enjoying the fun. This is his all time favorite movie and will watch it repeatedly. This movie will make his tears stop when no other cartoon can. I love this movie as well, it is a great combination of halloween, the meaning of promises and friendship. </p>

 <p> Little Roo is filled with excitement over being able to introduce his new friend, Lumpy the Heffalump, to his first Halloween ever! But, at one of Rabbit's usual celebration planning meetings, Tigger's musical explanation of the holiday terrifies poor Lumpy into not wanting to take part at all. Amidst all the excitement, Pooh devours the candy to be used for the festivities that evening, and everyone is at a loss for where to get more. Luckily, Tigger has told everyone his story about the Gobloon, a magical creature that grants a wish to anyone who catches him, but who will turn you into a Jaggedy Lantern if he catches you! Roo decides the only way to get more candy for everyone is to catch the Gobloon and WISH for more! After some convincing, Lumpy agrees to go with him, but their dark and frightening travels through the Hundred Acre Wood reduce Lumpy to a state of utter fright. Only after Roo relays to Lumpy the tale of a Halloween past, when Piglet went through a very similar struggle with fear of the holiday, is Lumpy able to regain the courage to carry on and face whatever dangers lurk in the woods on Halloween Night!"Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie" is a generally pleasing Halloween romp through the Hundred Acre Wood with only a few hang-ups (besides the usual lack of Owl and the not uncommon lack of Christopher Robin). The biggest complaint folks probably have with this 2005 direct-to-video follow-up to the theatrical "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" is no doubt the fact that about a 3rd of the film is made up of a Winnie the Pooh television special from several Halloweens back, "Boo to You, Too, Winnie the Pooh." Yes, occasionally, Disney releases an "All New" direct-to-video movie that is really just a compilation of TV show episodes or specials. This is often the case with Pooh and the gang direct-to-video releases. On the bright side, there is quite a bit of all new footage here too. In fact, if they had left the flashback to the old Halloween special out, they'd basically have a pretty  solid "all new" Holiday Special on their hands. Perhaps they should have just kept the two separate, but released them together on the one DVD. That way, they wouldn't have had to re-mat the television special to match the widescreen look of the new footage. Regardless, the older, 22-minute TV special (minus the credits and with some re-narrating) fits in well enough within the context of the new Heffalump plot, and the older footage looks only SLIGHTLY different. Two other issues come to mind though. One, this film is more targeted at young children than the "whole family," made clear with the focus on Roo and the new Heffalump character, Lumpy. Personally, I'm not totally in love with the Lumpy addition to the cast yet, though perhaps my problem is that I haven't seen the theatrical "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" yet. The other issue worth mentioning is that this is not the most captivating of films. Even the inclusion of "Boo To You, Too, Winnie the Pooh," doesn't help much, as it wasn't the most captivating of Halloween specials. Let me put it this way: The new footage, which is pretty much its own story, even though it surrounds the old Halloween special, focuses on Roo and Lumpy, as I stated before. The older footage, the made-for-television Halloween Special, focuses on Piglet. These, in my opinion, are not the most interesting Pooh cast members. Not having Pooh and Tigger onscreen enough is a problem with keeping THIS viewer's mind from wandering. Don't get me wrong, I love the Pooh movies, and maybe if I had watched this in the family room, on the large TV with the volume blasting, well, I probably wouldn't have had a problem then. However, when you cut back on the scenes with Tigger and Pooh, the Hundred Acre Wood gang is a little less entrancing. Still, I am not saying this DVD isn't worth owning. If you are a fan of Halloween programs and the Pooh gang, it's not without its charm and is definitely a must have. It even includes a handful of original songs amidst both the new and recycled footage. In fact, I've heard some folks say they prefer this Halloween themed release to "Pooh's Heffalump Movie." I really need to pick that one up and give it a watch. "Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie" is also the only way, currently, to get "Boo To You, Too, Winnie the Pooh" on DVD, though I have not decided to toss out my old VHS release yet, since it is still the only release of the original version. Over time though, I'm sure I'll realize that I more often reach for this longer Halloween "movie," with it's very nice picture and sound, over the old VHS, and will finally part ways with it. Though, I do hope that we eventually see a Winnie the Pooh "Holiday Collection" of the television specials, much like the Garfield one that is currently available and that I highly recommend. But, I'll be happy if they just release some boxed volumes of "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" to DVD, along with the long unseen short, "Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons."As for the DVD extras, well, there isn't much for an adult to be too thrilled about here, unless you are trying to plan some Halloween games for a group of kiddies. The extras basically include 3 games and a party planner (which just gives details on how to set up the 3 games). The first of the three games isn't half bad, and is basically a "look and find" game for little kiddies. The other two games aren't remote control games, but rather a hot potato type game called "Pass the Pumpkin," for which the DVD provides the music, and a Bingo game for which the DVD handles the number calling. You print out the cards via DVD-Rom features (which I pretty much never look into). Yeah, unless you're planning this kind of party, the only real reason to buy this film is because you love Pooh and Halloween programs, which I do. It's a bit overpriced (at 14.88 or thereabouts most places), but it's a worthy addition to your Pooh or Halloween DVD collection. </p>

 <p> I agree with some of the other reviewers--it's a rip-off!  The original Heffalump movie was so fresh and original, and then they take their wonderful new character and do a flash back.This movie scared my almost three-year-old to the point where she won't dress up to go trick-or-treating and yesterday, when we went for a walk, she was convinced the trees had "mouths with teeth" and were going to get her!It may be entertaining for slightly older kids, but keep it away from the littler ones.  :( </p>
