 <p> My son who has ocd loves this show. This is one of his favorite seasons to. It includes  episodes like House Fancy, Krabby road and Pineapple Fever. So if you like to take a trip down to Bikini Bottom then this is the dvd for you. </p>

 <p> This was for my Grandson. I do not like spongebob1 He does so I buy it for him. It is a silly cartoon but the kids love it and will watch it over any thing else. If you have Grand kids it will make a perfect gift. they will love and the parents will probably hate it. so it is a win win situtation. </p>

Penny Foolish/The Splinter3. Pest Of The West4. Giant Squidward/Giant Squidward5. Sun Bleached/House FancyDisc 2:6. No Nose Knows/Patty Caper7. Plankton's Regular/Boating Buddies8. Krabby Kronicle/Porous Pockets9. Who Bob What Pants10. Slumber Party/Grooming Gary11. Krusty Krushers/The Card12. Dear Vikings/Ditchin'Disc 3:13. Shuffle Boarding/Slide Whistle Stooges14. Cephalopod Lodge/Grandpappy The Pirate15. Professor Squidward/Sand Castles in the Sand16. Toy Store of Doom/Pets or Pests17. Komputer Overload/Choir Boys18. Spongebob vs. The Big OneDisc 4:19.

 <p> The 6th season of SpongeBob debuted in 2008 and concluded in 2010, and starting here, each season of SpongeBob would have 26 shows instead of only 20. If you'll notice by the time this season started, big words started to abound on SpongeBob, to make both kids and grownups alike have a bigger vocabulary. An easy way to learn such words is to turn on your TV's closed-captioning, to see how they're spelt, and then look them up in the Dictionary. This season contains Squilliam's first time in the show since season 3, the first time a "My leg!" gag is heard in the show since season 2, the Chum Coliseum gorefest-gone-bust, SpongeBob's vast knowledge of boating history, Mr. Krabs getting all worked up over a not-so-simple "penny" (Penny Foolish gives a nod to the first SpongeBob Movie during the movie theatre scene, and inadvertently the second movie as well!), a tribute to one of the greatest inventions in toon history (the slide whistle), SpongeBob VS The Big One, SpongeBob ditching Boating School (even though he had its bathroom key the whole time), Squidward in Boating School to make his driving record unsoiled again, SpongeBob's indirect revenge on Mr. Krabs & his get-rich-quick schemes (via The Krabby Kronicle), Squidward visiting SpongeBob, SpongeBob's RoundPants predicament, Plankton using a trio of robots to replace Karen in his latest formula scheme, SpongeBob & Patrick in an all-out sandcastle war, King Neptune's 5000th birthday, and the very first episode filmed in HD-Widescreen (and the first episode to take up 2 whole shows in production order), Truth Or Square. In this set, and in one of the half-season sets, Truth Or Square is completely unedited with lots of guest stars & other scenes not seen in the TV print! But unfortunately, this landmark episode is in letterbox-widescreen on this set; the black bars remain in the picture no matter what kind of TV you watch it on. It's the same way with It's A SpongeBob Christmas in season 8's set. Just like with seasons 4 and 5, season 6 is also a 2-in-1 reissue of its half-season sets, right down to the bonus features. It contains 9 shorts in all, a special short on how to make your own SpongeBob toy, the unedited Bollywood Bob music video, and the SpongeBob History Song (a bonus short that seemed to be meant for the First 100 Episodes set, but didn't make that set's final cut, and ended up here)! If you're a longtime fan of the show, don't hesitate to add this set to your SpongeBob season sets collection, unless you've already done it. Luckily, seasons 7 and 8 were whole season sets to begin with, making so many fans happy with such a decision to this day! </p>

 <p> The Big One, big words abound, SpongeBob changing pants and getting "married" to Sandy; all this and more in season 6! </p>
