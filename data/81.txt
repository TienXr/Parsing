 <p> Exact fit as described. I love the fact that it came with 2 sets. If it last like the original set I won't need any for 2-4 years. </p>

 <p> The windscreens in these packages fit MUCH better than the original.  I lost both original screens because my jacket would pull the tips off and I would loose them.  I thought about gluing the tips on and using small zip ties to hold them on but after getting these and getting them on I have not needed to &#34;fix&#34; them.They are kinda hard to get installed but that is also what makes them better than the originals.  They come off near as easy and still work just as well as the original.  If I use the earpiece covers I will update you on how they work but as of yet I have had no use for them as the originals work just fine. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Only purchased for the windscreen </p>

 <p> I dont just use these for blue parrot.  You can also put them over the mic inside your cars hands free or your gaming head set.With these foam parts I can stand over my detroit 60 series at high idle with the fan and speak comfortably on the phone. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> most important part! </p>

 <p> At first the 'leatherette' ear pieces seemed a little tight, but once on, they fit great and were as comfortable as new.  Good to be able to fix a wear item instead of throw away a good working headset! </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Great refresh </p>

 <p> Good value, good quality.  Bought it to replace some components.  Begs the question sometimes if just buying a new one is better, but inexpensive enough to not give buyer's remorse. </p>

 <p> They fit, and they work.  What more to say?  Well worth the investment.  Will order another set when needed.  Fixed a much needed item, as I have serious hearing problems.David </p>

 <p> These appear to be in improved product over what I got with my Blue Parrot headset new.I've had these a few months now and they are holding up even better than the originals. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Even nicer than the ones it came with. </p>

 <p> when you wear a head set and sweet this comes in handy after a few months and this one was pretty good </p>

 <p> I put the leatherette pad on and then the mesh pad over that.  It is a very snug fit but you get the cushion from the leather pad and the mesh keeps you from getting &#34;chapped ear&#34; when you are on for extended periods of time. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Works great </p>

 <p> The sponge and the plastic covering degrade over time, so these are great replacements.Seems like all manufacturers use the same padding, and these fit perfectly. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Great to replace old pads </p>
