 <p> This Speaker Base fitted nicely beneath the 42" LG TV in my bedroom and gave it a little more height which makes it even easier to view from the bed. The sound is very nice, a definite improvement over the LG flat panel speakers especially with surround sound turned on. It's more fun to watch movies with surround sound. I did not need a subwoofer since I was going to put this in the bedroom but I found it gives a good effect and I don't miss the subwoofer at all. I programmed my LG TV remote to learn the controls for this system and turn them up or down and also mute with the TV remote. I still have to program the Comcast Cable Box remote to learn the controls for this system. It also works with a Tivo Remote as I have tried that in the past.I also have the BA Tvee Model 30 system with the subwooferBoston Acoustics TVee Model 30 Sound System with Sleek Sound Bar and Wireless Subwoofer (Black)in my living room and sometimes have to turn off the subwoofer when I am not watching a movie as the thump can get annoying if you are watching a talk show. You also need to be careful if you have neighbors below you when you use a subwoofer as it can get loud. For that reason, I prefer this base as it's nice and compact, and has pretty good sound without a subwoofer. It is also a little more expensive than the sound bar system with subwoofer.Overall, a nice system to get if you want something compact that can slide under your TV. Otherwise, there are many choices in this price range, including 5 speaker sets that sound really great - especially if you already have a receiver. </p>

 <p> This is an intriguing device. How great can a sound bar like device work without the subwoofer? How much improvement can you get over your TV speakers? Turns out the answers are: better than you'd expect.This device is a but if an odd duck, because I personally feel like someone who cares enough to replace there TV speakers with something else will opt for the added depth that a sub provides. And at this price point there are a few home theatre in a box options out there. That being said this really outperformed my expectations.First I have never had an easier set up. Ever. The toughest part is moving your TV. Plug in the power, plug in your optical or coax from your TV and you're rocking and rolling. (It includes both cables plus an RCA if you need to use that.) The unit automatically turns on and off when it detects your TV is on. The Bluetooth syncs easy to your phone or tablet. The toughest part is trying to get your remote working with it. And even that they make as easy as possible because the device learns your remote rather than the other way. (I got my cable to work very easily, but my Harmony one proved difficult because of its multiple devices wired to diff buttons for different activities--though I think I could get it going with a little more push.)As a noted earlier the sound quality is nothing short of miraculous for the little good looking box. It reminds me of the first time I heard a Bose Wave radio. It's not the best, but is very rich and deep for its size. This will change your life if you're accustomed to flat panel sound. I still prefer my sound bar with woofer because of the bass. But it did take 50x longer to set up, has 10x the wires and all manner of pass throughs. And it's big and kinda ugly--where this unit seamlessly blends in.And lastly a note on the Base. If you have a plasma tv (mine is 42" and 5 years old) you need to check the stand size against the measurements of the unit. Mine barely fits on the stand. According to the manual anything that hangs over at all is not OK. When I start to approach max volume and scenes have heavy bass my TV vibrates a bit. Also this base makes it tougher to swivel my TV. It would have been nice to put a vibration dampening swivel on top! (Might be too much engineering/expense involved, admittedly.)All in all I highly recommend this if you're someone who values form slightly over function. Or if you like simple and need better sound. This is excellent for the non techie in your life that needs/wants improved sound. Some audio solutions will provide better sound because of their discrete woofer, but none will look as good or be as easy to set up as this one. You get 80%+ of there sound with 10% of the work and wires and clutter. </p>

 <p> I've never had much of a home theater system, relying solely on the speaker system within the TV, which has always been a CRT unit until we recently upgraded to aSamsung LED HDTV. The Samsung's audio system is certainly adequate for our needs, but with the addition of the TVee One, home theater has a new meaning! Frankly I didn't know a unit like this existed - one that serves as the base for a TV while providing excellent sound quality.The coolest thing about the TVee One is that it turns on automatically when the TV comes on. I had no idea it could do this until I set it up, which was very easy to do I might add. So, no remote necessary! We all know how remotes are annoying.If you're looking to improve your TV's sound and maintain a small footprint, look no further than the TVee One. </p>

 <p> For those who aren't familiar, Boston Acoustics is owned by D&M; Holdings, the same company that owns high-end audio brands Marantz and Denon. Unfortunately, the TVee One doesn't seem to share their aesthetic sensibilities. Looking a bit like an old-fashioned3M Desktop Keyboard Drawer, the matte black plastic TVee One base won't win any beauty contests for its boxy, utilitarian design but it does create room-filling sound.This product is a practical alternative for people who don't want to fuss with the cost or setup of a traditional surround sound system, which would require an audio receiver, a subwoofer, and multiple speakers. The TVee One is one piece of equipment. It sits under the TV and needs only 1 wire to set up. It only takes a few minutes and probably the hardest part is getting your TV on top of the base (mine weighs over 50 pounds). Connect the supplied TOS-Link digital audio cable from the back of the TV to the back of the TVee One and you're ready for show time. If your TV is really old, there is also a co-ax and analog audio plug but it may be time to consider a new TV if that's the case. I did wish for an HDMI port however, for better future-proofing, as HDMI is the current best interface for home electronics.The speakers can get very very loud, but I didn't test the maximum output out of consideration of my neighbors. The bass is strong and thumping, but if you really want room shaking bass, you'd need a real subwoofer. Pairing with Bluetooth is very easy as well. I play music through it from my iPhone 4S. I didn't like the flat remote control at all. It felt flimsy and is the same kind that typically come with cheap electronics. When on standby however, you have to push the power button in order for Bluetooth to pair with the base again. After that, you can stream to the speakers using AirPlay.Overall, the TVee One does its job. It's not pretty, but that's strictly a matter of opinion. The 5 year warranty is among the most generous in the industry. </p>

 <p> disappointing. I bought this at the same time as the Energy Powerbase and the Onkyo base to try them all out. The boston isnt made very well (all plastic) compared to the Energy which is wood. The biggest difference is the bass performance. the Boston has very little where the Energy pounded. I am glad it had an adjustment so my 15 yr old didnt drive me crazy. The boston was thin but didnt handle much weight. i was a little afraid to put my 50&#34; plasma on it. their is also unedfeatable LED's that light up like Christmas trees across the front of it which was very strange. I will update this when i finish with the Onkyo. Sending back the Boston now. </p>

 <p> This speaker sits under your TV so make sure you are not bigger then what is recommended.  I believe it is 50" or smaller but you will want to read the description to double check.  It is very slim and very nice sounding.  I put it in my sons room under a 32" tv and he has his xbox connected to it and it is very crisp.  The blutooth connection is easy to set up as well and sounds good.  This is a solid addition if you dont have a lot of room for a speaker setup or a sound bar setup.  It is smaller though so consider that when you go to buy it.  It does put out good sound and if space is an issue this could be the item for you. </p>

 <p> This is a good product, however, unfortunately, it isn't as good as i'd hoped.  I have owned a number of Boston products, from car speakers to home theatre.  All have been very good to excellent.  I was surprised to find that this didn't quite live up to the others.  Here are some of the things that I don't care for about it:- The bass is 'boomy'.  And it's that constant, annoying 'boomy'. I live in a townhome and wanted something that sounded good at low volumes.  Even at that low level, the bass just didn't sound good.  In fact, it sounded downright bad.  It may be because the box is ported, and my preference is accurate, tight base (sealed enclosure).  So I stuck socks in both ports.  That solved the issue.  That said, I shouldn't have to do that with a $300 speaker.  Include some port plugs or add a setting that turns off the bass completely.- It's plastic.  It feels cheap, and it looks it too.  It has, thus far, held my 47&#34; without trouble, so it's sturdy, but it still looks and feels cheap.  There are others out there for little more that are built with wood.  Something that you may want to consider.- The included optical cable is garbage.  So are the RCAs.  Purchase a $6 Amazon optical cable if you do end up buying this.The things I love about it:- Remote learning feature.  I have programmed my volume up/down into the unit, so I don't need to mess with separate remotes.  I also programmed the power button as well, however, that's not needed as it appears to power down on its own after X minutes.  Note that any button on the front of the unit can be programmed into your TV remote.  VERY cool!- Different sound fields.  We all have different taste; this gives you 5, as I recall.  I like the dialogue and theatre wide sound fields.  You may like the others.  That's a nice option to have.- It fixed the 'issue' that I had with my TV.  It had to be cranked up in order to hear the dialogue.  That is, it wasn't the same volume for soundFX/effects, music, and dialogue.  When cranked up, dialogue was fine, but an explosion would wake up the neighbors.  I hated that.  This speaker fixed it.Would I buy it again?  That's a tough one.  I like it, but it's $300.  I didn't spend as much time as I should have researching.  Because of my experience with Boston in the past, I just went for it.  If I had it to do over, I would have done more research on other, competing units. </p>

 <p> We wanted something that improved dialogue which seemed to be getting lost in the music and sound effects, especially when watching a movie. And this does exactly what we were looking for. No one will mistake this for a home theatre setup or a sound bar with a separate sub woofer, but it does add a nice little punch to music and special effects. Dialogue is very clear and allows us to keep the sound level lower than we did with the TV sound alone. Design is clean and unobtrusive and build quality on par with the more expensive Bose unit. Setup was easy and it came with excellent instructions and quick start guide. Learning remote feature was a snap with Verizon Fios remote. This is a simple, no hassle solution for people who have limited real estate in the living room, don't want to deal with wires and have realistic expectations about what this kind of box can and cannot do. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> My review is based on a comparison to a Bose sound dock II as that's what we used as our entertainment sound prior to this purchase. Our new entertainment center has no place for the sound dock and we also wanted to upgrade to Bluetooth. We really had hoped this unit would maintain the sound quality of the sound dock, but it falls short. The deeper base and fullness of sound are somewhat lost with this unit. It's not bad, but just not great either. The things we like: fit finish and quality seem good, sound is above par, it turns on with the tv automatically, easy set up, some control over the sound with preset functions, sleek/unobtrusive and Bluetooth capable. What we don't like: Bluetooth connectivity is glitchy (if one device is connected, no one else can until that device is disconnected), my directv remote only learned some of the functions-not all, the sound quality is a little bit of a let down. On a side note, the remote was doa. Just as you would expect, a call to amazon support and that issue was handled in minutes. 4 stars as it serves it's purpose but it would get 5 if the sound quality were improved. For that, I would gladly pay another $50-$75! </p>

 <p> HUGE SOUND!! Have a Samsung Blue Tooth sound bar for the large screen in our main viewing room and got the Boston Acoustics TVee One for our family room for use with a 47"HD, and everyone likes the sound on the TVee One over the Samsung.The Boston Acoustics TVee One is big, like original dvd player big, which is understandable when it's designed to be the base for up to a 50lb tv to sit on - just make sure that the base of the tv is not larger than the dimensions of the TVee One. Also, after initial setup the back of the TVee One was placed too close to the wall and once I moved it away from the wall the sound improved.ProsGreat SoundEasy Setup/Programming/UseConsRemote Has Strong Plastics Smell </p>

 <p> I wasn't sure how I felt about this speaker in the beginning, but this was mostly due to my own errors. First, it states in the instructions that this system works best when in an open space that isn't blocked; however, I had to put it in an entertainment center so that initially affected the sound quality. I decided to re-arrange things a bit to give more space around it and the sound improved a lot. I especially like that the system turns on and off with the television and once I figured out the sound configurations I was able to find one that works well for my space. My biggest complaint is that I couldn't get the speaker to sink with my universal remote, which is strange because it's a newer model so it should be compatible. Although it is very possible that I'm doing something wrong lol, so I probably shouldn't hold that against the speaker. </p>

 <p> This is it.  This is exactly what I wanted to improve the sound quality of our flat screen TV.  We've gone through various configurations of stereo equipment, then moved to Panasonic SC-HTB770 (which sounded good while it was working but had a weird power issue - so that wasn't all that often) - and then - we got the TVee One.First of all, it took me longer to get this out of the box it arrived in than to set up.  The instructions were clear, brief and simple.  I was a bit unsure about setting our 47" TV on it - how stable it would be - but that turned out to be worry for nothing.  It is the perfect size, works as a base and almost looks like part of the TV itself.The engineers of this speaker base must have had people like me in mind.  People who think, "UGH!  I don't want to have to remember to turn it on every time I turn on the TV."  No need.  It turns itself on automatically when the device plugged into it (the TV) is turned on.  People who think, "NO!  I don't want to have to use yet another remote."  No need.  In a process that took me under a minute, the TVee One can learn your existing remote.  After than, unless you need to change the sound types (music, movie, movie wide, etc) - you can file the remote away.And the sound is great.  Great for watching TV and listening to music (which is also crazy easy to setup using Bluetooth).  I guess if I was very VERY picky?  I'd say it could use a bit more depth?  But my guess is that would require use of a subwoofer - and I just want one device.  One simple, streamlined, quality device.  I will certainly give up just a tiny bit of bass for that.Seriously - this is just what I was looking for.  I am SO glad I have this and I would give it my highest recommendation. </p>

 <p> I got this on a factory refurbished equipment site for less than half price. What a great deal for even full price. This speaker base improves the TV sound immensely. Listening to iTunes radio through the Apple TV box attached to the TV, you will be amazed by the clarity, brightness and full range of the sound. Anyone who feels there is not enough bass should listen to any iTunes jazz station. Bass is accurate but not overdone which I personally appreciate. The remote is a little cheap but adequate and you can easily pair your own TV remote to the unit which makes it much more convenient to control. The volume and listening mode indicator lights are a little primitive, but easy to understand after a couple of minutes of use. This has so greatly improved the sound from the TV and internet radio that TV viewing and listening has become  much more enjoyable. The Bluetooth is easy to setup and works well but the sound is the usual slightly compromised Bluetooth sound. Listening through the included optical cable is the optimal way to use this machine. Someone mentioned that the included optical cable is a little cheap feeling, and it is, but it works perfectly well so there's no need to get another one of these cables. If you want a very easy, clutter free, non-complicated and no hassle solution to poor TV sound you really can't beat this. </p>

 <p> THERE IS ALMOST NO BASS. Now, if bottom-end is more important than loud, clean sound, look elsewhere. I do love a pounding movie soundtrack, and enjoy my main home theater system. I don't need that in my bedroom setup. I just wanted something to elevate the audio, without blowing me out of the room during action scenes. This has a great night listening mode, which I keep it on. The most surprising aspect is how loud the volume can go, producing a very well-simulated surround effect throughout our average-sized bedroom. I bought one through Warehouse Deals used, and I believe $130-$150 is a fair price. $200+ is pushing it, especially since, there's no subwoofer out to add an extra kick. </p>

 <p> Although this TV speaker base looks very similar to more expensive speakers, for the price it seems like less that what you would expect. Although this definitely increases volume of TV and game sound, even after TV and speaker adjustment, this louder sound does not sound as crisp and clear as even some TV speakers.For me there was also an issue with the tiny ~1&#34; by ~2&#34; remote that come with this unit. Although some TVs are supposed to be able to control this unit (according to included instructions) my very new Samsung 42' that this unit was purchased for was not able to, so now I am required to use the tiny, rubbery feeling, easy to lose remote whenever I need to adjust the volume.There is no LCD screen or any on screen indication of how high you currently have the volume set, and this unit tries to let the user know how high the volume is set by lighting the few buttons across its front sequentially. It makes adjustment feel very crude and requires adjustment by ear (instead of just setting the volume to a number).Finally, the ports on the back of the device are somewhat limited. Although I used the digital audio input easily from my TV to the unit, when I later wanted to hook up an old gaming system, I found there are no RCA connectors on the back, but a headphone jack that requires an included RCA to headphone dongle. Although the dongle works, I was surprised that a unit this expensive did not want to give users a solid set of plugs on the back, rather than a dongle that adds to wire congestion behind my entertainment unit.To sum it up, this is an OK sounding speakers with some design issues that make it a lot less fun and easy to use. </p>

 <p> When I saw the TVee One I was immediately intrigued. This speaker worker like a champ. The base is sturdy enough to hold up to about a 60" TV,is low profile and tastefully designed to work well with virtually any decor.And the sound is glorious. Boston Acoustics seems to know how to focus the right amount of sound like it is coming directly right from the TV/monitor screen but still envelop the room with the effect of a multi-channel audio system. For those like me who often refer to Bose speakers as delivering miraculous sound from a small box, these are just as impressive but more natural sounding than Bose's highly processed sound field. Specifically the bass is clean and solid way down low, the highs are bright and sparkling and the mid-range is perfect for dialog and musical vocals.Here are some features to be aware of:- There is a row of control buttons along the upper-front panel that double as helpful status lights depending on how many and which of them are illuminated at any given time (they self-dim after a few seconds so as not to distract from watching TV). Kudos that they are angled so they can be seen from both a seated or standing position.- There is a 5-way built-in equalizer for dialog, music, music wide, movie and movie wide which have a significant effect on the stereo or surround sound effect. The included remote control also has a "night" mode to limit the dynamic range for late night listening.- The speaker has an easy to set up Bluetooth feature built in, a great way to play music from a smartphone or tablet.- There are two types of optical audio inputs plus an analog input on the rear. The speaker automatically selects the appropriate input and turns itself on and off with the TV (which you can override). All of the necessary cables are included in the box as well as a full-function remote control- The TVee One has a built-in processor to "teach" virtually any type of remote control the various functions, it's as simple as pushing a button- IMPORTANT: A small difference in how you place the speaker can make a big difference in the sound quality due to the dual ducted ports on the rear. Do NOT push it up against a wall or the sound will be terrible. Also, it is not wise to have a soft surface like curtains behind the speaker. I found a significant difference in sound quality (especially bass) when I moved the speaker forward to 3" from a hard-surfaced wall from the 2" where I originally had it. Bottom line: the rear ports have a very big impact on the quality of the sound.Hookup is simple and it has classic restrained styling, no annoying gaudy logos, just a small subtle nameplate. After seeing and hearing it I am now using it coupled with a dedicated network receiver in my den on a lowboy bookcase where it is ideal for listening to morning news and a wide variety of music genres during the day plus I can instantly switch to play Bluetooth audio from my phone or iPad. The unexpectedly good sound and reasonable price earns a solid positive rating. </p>

 <p> I purchased this because of the BA name and the fact that I have enjoyed my BA Recepter radio for years, which has excellent audio and front end. In any case, I set this device up, just like the instructions said. I used an optical cable setup and turned off the Televisions internal audio output. The sound from this device was terrible. There is virtually no bass. The voices were not nearly as clear as they were from my TV's on board speakers. I tried all the different modes (5 or 6) and barely noticed any difference at all. After messing around with this device for a couple of days, I decided that it had to be defective, since I can't imagine that Boston Acoustics would put out such a poor quality device. I returned the system and will look elsewhere. Shame on BA if this is the way the unit is supposed to sound. </p>

 <p> Boss. So yesterday and over priced. This B. Acoustics rocks. Easy to set up , easy to use, and is truly wonderful in sound. While plastic, it is solid and hard. It supports my 42 inch TV. Great sound and  great looking box. Price for this item will go up in time as it becomes well known. Not like the staid over priced Bose. Go for it. It works, sounds wonderful , if you need great sound, go for it. You shall not regret it. Sure beats a sound bar that gets in the way or a bass speaker that often comes with those sound bars. Myself, don't like the ghetto thump bass you get with those.  Might even buy some blue tooth speakers to put around it in the living room to accent. If I do, will go with high end. OK, nuff said. </p>

 <p> The Boston Acoustics TVee One speaker base is intended to improve the quality of broadcast television sound from what would be available on the standard flatscreen tv. This is not the product to buy if one intends to create a theatrical experience when watching blu rays, stadium experience when watching games, or thundering crunches while playing video games. It is, however, an easy-to-install, solid-sounding unit to create a richer, fuller sound for television viewing. It has an unobtrusive utilitarian look, fits neatly under the flatscreen tv's stand (pay attention to the size requirement, however; one should be careful about placing even a 50" screen on it), and works well with tv's remote after its simple set up. It would be a welcome present for those who like warm, full sound without a great deal of technical involvement and also for those who are working with a small space. Recommended. </p>

 <p> Definitely a big improvement on the terrible sound quality of the Panasonic ST50 I have.  Easy to set up, and fits well with my TV unlike a traditional soundbar, which would block the remote sensor if I tried to put it in front of the TV on the stand.  Some reviewers have described it as cheap feeling, but I'd say having it be light weight is more practical.  It's just plain black, so doesn't look like anything in particular, which is best, and I don't need a significant extra weight in addition to my TV threatening to break my flimsy TV stand.  Two problems.  The light coding system they use to tell you what listening mode you are in (dialog boosted, music, movie, etc.) is absurd.  Just completely stupid.  It flashes a completely random series of lights associated with each mode that have no relationship to anything.  I'm sure I'll never memorize this semaphore code system, so I'm stuck with the giant owners manual (it's like 15&#34; by 20&#34; for no good reason) sitting on my coffee table as a reference.  There is plenty of room on the unit's front for a dedicated mode indicator, so this is just bad design.  Second, while it's easy to set up other remotes to work this, it seems a bit unresponsive.  It will work eventually, but I tend to have to hold down the mute or volume buttons on my TV remote and wait for  a second or so before the TVee One responds. </p>

 <p> I needed to buy a platform type sound bar for my flat screen. I didn't want a subwoofer and a lot of wires running everywhere.I took a chance with the Boston Acoustics as I had not heard it and was buying strictly based on the past good reputation of the company. Also Amazon had a great deal on this one so I snapped it up. Keeping in mind that this is to enhance the tv audio andnot to rattle the windows, it is fine. Setup was easy to my Directv remote and I'm good to go. There are three different soundoptions you can chose. The unit is furnished with an optical audio cable and it is probably fine but very very cheap, what do youexpect? Buy yourself a quality optical cable ( Nyrius NWOC500) $10 and done on Amazon. </p>
