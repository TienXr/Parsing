 <p> I use this charger for the 18650 rechargeable flashlight battery I own. Sometimes it gets a little finicky and I have to unplug and plug it back into the wall again. That's why I knocked the star off. For the price, I liked the purchase. </p>

 <p> Only four stars because this charger does not have temperature sensor. This can be very dangerous when cheap, defective battery starts to over-heat, the will not automatically  shut-off this is the part ewhere your house burns down.Place it on a surface that can tolerate high temperatures, such as top of the stove or at the very least use a metal cookie sheet. (I prefer to put the charger at the end of a 100 foot extension cord well away from the house ;-) Do not leave it plugged into the wall outlet, and remove the batteries from the charger nightly or when you can't watch it.If your the forgetful type, spent the money to get a safer, more expensive charger.P.s. got mine direct from china, for $1 and a 40 day wait ... it's worth it! </p>

 <p> These cheap chargers do not stop charging at a safe voltage. Get one that stops at 4.25 volts or your cheap batterys could catch fire or even explode!!! </p>

 <p> I have one 18650 flashlight and two batteries.  I will probably not need more batteries for quite some time.  I keep one battery charged and one battery in the drawer (you know, THE drawer).  I didn't need anything bigger, and sometimes it is hard to find a spot in the outlet for a charger with a bigger footprint.  The unit feels a little &#34;cheap&#34;,  But it works perfectly every time and at this price, who am I to complain.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend, or a relative I like. </p>

 <p> it seems like a dual channel charger, not a single.  it does charge to 4.2v in 3 hours, current test of 1 of 2 purchased at 3.5 hours at 4.25 volts. hope it automatically turns off at 4.3 volts.update: 1 of 2 chargers died, has a transformer inside that hums real loud and LEDs blink real fast for any battery(02-26-2014).I will most likely be ordering 2 more. </p>

 <p> I read others' reviews of this product so despite not having instructions I was ready to use it the moment I unpacked it. As soon as I put my depleted rechargable cells in there, both LEDs went to flashing red when they should have gone solid red. I removed and reinserted them to the same result. I swapped their position and it was still the same. Without cells the light is green like it should be, but what is this flashing nonsense?I tried a single cell, and I got a solid red light. I tried the other cell and got a solid red light. Either cell will charge alone apparently, but both won't charge together. I got the spare set of cells and they do the same thing. Doesn't matter which of the four cells I try or which spot I put it in. So I was resigned to charging one cell at a time. I repositioned it so that I could see when it finished charging, and I managed to drop it on the floor and the cell popped out. Sometime after that it became able to charge two cells at once like it should.I have no explanation. If you paid less than $5 for your charger and are having problems with it, try dropping it on the floor a time or two.Update: after a couple cycles, it went back to only being able to charge one cell at a time. Not sure if this is a design issue or QC problem, but I don't know if I feel safe charging cells in this. </p>

 <p> I bought two of these for friends.  They were delivered to my house, and I decided to test them out with some new batteries.  The charger appears to be well constructed.  It charged new ultrafire batteries without any trouble (cheap batteries that I have issues with making proper contact in the Tenergy charger).  There is a red/green LED on both sides of the charger.  When there is no battery present the green LED will illuminate.  When there a battery present that is not fully charged, the red LED will illuminate.  When the battery is fully charged, the LED changed to green. I put some batteries in this charger that I had fully charged on my other charger, and they turned the LED green right away (that's good).  Out of curiousity, I installed a battery backwards (reverse polarity). In this case the charger LED extinguished completely.  I don't know exactly what that means. On my much pricier Tenergy charger (which advertises polarity protection) the charger will blink alternating red and green and makes an audible clicking sound.  I don't have the stones to leave the battery in the charger this way to find out.  My guess is that it does detect the polarity and shuts down, but I would not bet my life on it.  Some people have suggested charging your unprotected cells by placing your charger in a metal box (like a cookie tin or lunch box).  This charger would lend itself well to that, as it has a cord (although the Tenegy with the detachable cord would make it so you could just drill a small hole in the side of the metal box).  I monitored the battery temp, and the charger temp with my IR thermometer, and both of them stayed at reasonable temperatures (below 95F in a 73F ambient room).  I would be cautious with anything this cheap made in China that has the potential to burn your house down, but my limited experience with them is good.  These chargers will be given to friends, and I will caution them not to charge batteries unattended.  One thing to note is that this charger has a spring contact on the negative terminal side. As a result, this will not work with 14500 LiIon cells (unless you put a conductive spacer/shim there :{ ).  It might work with two CR123 sized LiIon cells stacked, but I don't know if that is safe or not.  The most read negative review for this product states that the charger does NOT shut off when the charge is complete.  I can't test to determine for sure, but I can state that the temperature of the batteries and the charger dropped back down to ambient room temp shortly after the batteries were fully charged. </p>

 <p> Charges to 4.2v, simple, very solid. simple LED indicators (Red charging, Green done/ slots empty). Cord could be a bit longer and i wouldn't have minded some dead weight in it to help keep it on a desk or table better. Did i mention this thing is stupidly well built? it doesn't feel cheap or &#34;chinese&#34;, feels like an unbranded top name OEM product </p>

 <p> I bought this charger to go with myNitecore MT26 flashlight, andUltrafire 18650 batteries. It works like a charm. It takes about 4 hours to charge the batteries, after which they last about 1 1/2 hours on "turbo" mode in my flashlight. I've used this charger to recharge my 18650 batteries at least 3 times each, and have experienced zero problems. I always make sure to take the battery out as soon as I notice the light for it's channel has turned green. Being able to charge one battery at a time is a great thing when you're using a pair of batteries with a device that requires only one battery. This way you can keep one in use, and one on standby ready to swap. You don't have to wait until both batteries are dead before charging.I highly recommend this charger as it is well made for the price and works great. </p>

 <p> I bought this for my 18650 batteries and was really worried about the &#34;generic&#34; quality of a charger for a high powered battery.So far so good, the light is red when charging, green when it's done, but I'm trusting that the meter is properly calibrated.It does independently charge each single battery, so you can charge one and use the other. </p>
