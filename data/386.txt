 <p> I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review4.5 StarsMuse Unexpected is an intriguing story rich with Greek Mythology. I haven't read a story about muses before, so for me this is a new take on the whole demigod plot. It's fast-paced, the story almost impossible to put down once started.The story opens with Sophie's grandmother, Georgia, back when she was young and desperate to regain her birthright as a muse. Georgia is willing to sacrifice not only her own chance at happiness but that of her progeny in her lust for power and greed. Not a very likable character. When she first reappears back in Sophie and Callie's lives, I wanted to slap her. While suffering through her father's death, Sophie is transformed into a muse, which as it turns out is not an easy process. The relationship between grandmother Georgia, mother Callie, and daughter Sophie is fraught with mistrust and deeply ingrained hurt.Mr. Birlidis weaves amazing imagery throughout this novel. At the beginning, I felt like I was there with Georgia in Greece. In addition the characters are well-written, easy to love or hate. The parade of endless mythological creatures is a real treat, though I doubt Sophie would agree with my assessment. I wasn't a huge fan of the dialogue, but the intriguing plot more than made up for it.Muse Unexpected is a gripping story that will appeal to teens and adults alike. If you like mythology based stories, definitely add this one to your TBR list.You can find this review and many more at [...] </p>

 <p> V.C. Birlidis' Muse Unexpected is a wonderful new fantasy dealing with a family of muses. Sophie's tragic love story, in my opinion, plays second fiddle to Birlidis' ability to give us lush descriptions. I simply loved the way he described Greece. It made me want to visit someday.Don't get me wrong, this story is full of romance, action, mythological beings, and angst. I just can't stop gushing over the settings.Birlidis is a new author to watch out for. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. </p>

 <p> Where to start with this book!  I guess I want to first point out that on the cover it says Book 1.  I am pointing this out because the author does a great job helping us to truly understand the back history or why things are the way they are in today's setting.  Birlidis is laying the foundation and the foundation last up until the last few chapters of the book.  So, we really get a good idea of some of the characters, landscape, and even the history.  If you are like me, you get a little anxious wondering if anything really world changing is going to happen.  I promise, it is worth it and you will be glad Birlidis lays such a great foundation for the ending and for others to come.One thing I really like about this book is the fact that the teenager acts like a REAL TEENAGER!  She has the emotions of what typical teenager would have, but most importantly when the supernatural world is introduced to her she reacts like most teenager girls would.  I've read book in the past where the girls do not flinch at this new scary world they meet.  This is not realistic because they would flinch some.  Birlidis has her main character flinch but also always her to move on quicker.  So, we do not linger on a whine a teenager.Now to the characters.  We meet several in this book but we come to know all, most, or some of their story.  The book starts off with us meeting Georgia.  The book really grabs your attention because she is exciting and hardcore from the beginning.  I ended up have a love/hate relationship with her all the way to the end.  I cannot tell you at this point if I finally liked her or not.Callie is Georgia's daughter and Sophia's mother.  Callie I like.  She knows her place and where she belongs.  She loves her daughter and would do anything for her.  I think if it was for her I would probably really dislike Georgia.  Callie has a way of helping your emotion flip flop about Georgia but you will love Callie till the end.Sophia is the main character.  Her personality is likable but like a teenager she doesn't listen so well.  I had to keep remember that she is only a teenager entering world and role a little too big for her. That helped me from wanting to slap her and tell her to be careful and make better choices.Sophia has two friends that enter her life once she enters the world of Muse's: Angela and Bennett.  I really like Angela because she has sweet personality and loyal.  Of course every story has to have a love interest.  I think this one builds and transpires how a typical teenage romance would.  Bennett is one that is left a little mysterious because we do not learn too much about him but enough that you really wouldn't care if you did learn anything else about him.I will say this book had some exciting moments but I felt that once Sophia entered the world of Muse's it lacked that excitement.  However, it is because Birlidis was not rushing Sophia into anything.  Sophia learns a lot and we learn a lot with her.  Birlidis did not just rush us into making Sophia the hero; we actually get to take our time with as she lives out each day.  This was refreshing.  What really made me like this book was the ending.  I wasn't sure how I felt about but when I got to the last few pages and the last page I can say it left me going...WHAT!!!  If a book has a great ending, it was worth reading through the set up.  I would recommend this book and say keep reading because the ending will rock your world! </p>

 <p> Muse Unexpected was a new twist onGreek mythology in the modern world. I loved the description of what the gods and goddesses were and how they came about, along with the various demigods. I give this book 4 stars, but I wish I could divide it into three and give it different ratings.The beginning is definitely 4 stars. It opens with a very dramatic scene and jumps right into the story introducing all three of our main characters spectacularly. Birlidis does a great job of giving the personalities that really draw you into their lives and lead you down a path of how they relate to each other.About a third of the way in though, things die down....a lot. The middle part of the story featuring Sofie in her new home in Greece really dragged for me - much closer to a three star rating. There were quite a few scenes that looked like they may be important, but nothing ever came of them. Even though they were intriguing, they seemed to be more page filler than necessary and I kept wondering why it wasn't brought into the story again.The last third of the book was close to a five star rating. Once things start happening - they really start happening. With Sofie's ball and party quickly approaching, we can tell that this will be the turning point of the story. With the gods conspiring against her, it's hard to imagine how she will be able to succeed in her duties, but with a very very very surprise ending a lot of things from the beginning start to fall into place. Over all this was a very good read and a anyone who enjoys a good mythology tale will enjoy it.*This book was received in exchange for an honest review* </p>

 <p> I remember learning about mythology & Greek gods in elementary school....boring!  Well, this fantastic book takes everything you thought about gods/mythology and turns it on it's ear, sort of like &#34;Wicked&#34; did to the &#34;Wizard of OZ&#34;. At times funny at times gruesome and scary, this story definitely kept my interest.  I loved the way the writer made the gods &#34;human&#34;.  I also liked the subtle, blink and you'll miss them hints sprinkled throughout the story.Don't let the young adult genre scare you away.  This is an engaging story that can be enjoyed by all.  Can't wait for the next one!!!! </p>

Honestly I read this book from beginning to end in a few hours. Highly Recommend, awesome book </p>

 <p> V. C. Birlidis has found a way to blend two independent mythologies into a single unit in a manner that not only makes sense, but also deepens both storylines.  Applied to the modern era, we learn of a Harry Potter-like behind-the-scenes world that is rife with schems, ambition and devine intervention. </p>

 <p> VC  Birlidis' debut novel, Muse Unexpected was a fabulous read. A new take on the muses in mythology written with a smart voice, magical world building and cinematic effects will leave you wanting more. This is a fun book to read, sassy, scary & sweet with lots of developed female characters and a thought out family dynamic. It&#8217;s clear the author had as much fun writing it as I did reading it. I can&#8217;t wait to read more from this new, upcoming author! </p>

 <p> Brilliantly written! I love Mythology and V.C.'s approach to the amazing mythos is epic! The characters are entertaining and quirky! I love the story line and the way it flows. I can't wait for the next book!Sophie's life takes a drastic turn when tragedy strikes. Whisked away to her grandmother's home across the ocean is unsettling to say the least. Sophie learns a monstrous family secret that creates a major metamorphosis. Sophie must chose whether to accept her fate or turn her back on mankind. Debts are called to be settled and the fight between myths collide. Will Sophie's life be a tragedy or great mythic legend? </p>

 <p> Would I recommend it?:Absolutely not. It was impossible to like any of the characters or to get hooked on the story. I couldn't finish it. I had high hopes for it so I was really disappointed. I just give this book a big fat nope.Other notes (Possible Spoilers):-I guess it's an original idea but the start is very boring. I skimmed it, mostly. It was too much boring description about a girl I didn't care about. Also, it was gross. I don't want to pick up a book and immediately read that they ripped their fingernail completely off.-Why is Callie talking out loud when she is alone? People don't do that, not in complete sentences. This is just bad writing. She actually goes between thinking and replying to her thoughts out loud.-Way too many long-winded descriptions. He's not a good enough writer to make it interesting. I skimmed most of the long paragraphs because there was no point to them.-We're on the third chapter and so far there is nothing linking Georgia and Callie. This shouldn't be something held off as a mysterious thing, if I don't know why they're connected why the hell should I care about them? Say it immediately, don't wait for no reason.-None of the characters talk realistically.-The line about her father dying was the most terrible delivery I've ever read and the characters handled it unrealistically. I feel no sympathy for them. They get over it in about a second. I mourned a torn pair of jeans longer than they mourned for their father/husband.-She calls her mother by her first name. This is not a thing that happens. I am about done with this book.-Boat captains can't really marry people unless you're on a cruise ship and you're in international waters and they are otherwise authorized to do so. Overall, this is unrealistic and based off of a Hollywood misconception. Also, why would they take a boat to America from Greece?-I couldn't read past chapter six. Maybe I'll come back and update this if I get the energy to try again, but by chapter six you should have the reader hooked, not wishing all the characters would die suddenly.*A free copy of this novel was given in exchange for an honest review* </p>

 <p> The storyline of this book is superb! I recently discovered that I very much enjoy a book that manages to blend Greek mythology with Christianity as a way of explaining how both religions came to be; and the thesis proposed by this author was great. I definitely bought into it; in a fictional way of course. The plot is intriguing and engaging and I found myself invested in the story from page one.I loved that the author chose to put the main focus in Muses. I feel they are some mythological characters that had been left behind and sort of forgotten in modern literature, so it was a fresh point of view of Mythology. Plus, I love muses and what they do.Nevertheless, the main issue I had is that I didn&#8217;t like the mixture of Greek mythology with other sorts of myths or traditions. I loved all the effort and detail the author put into the world building, but I think that goblins and vampires just don&#8217;t mix well with Gods and Demigods. Greek mythology is very rich in itself so why invite everyone to the party? But that is just me, maybe you will enjoy that.Since a great part of the book is dedicated to setting the background of the story, we get to know a lot of characters and their personal history, so in general they are very three-dimensional. It was a bit hard to keep tabs on everyone, until I became familiar with them, thouhg.Especial recognition to Aletheria, the Oracle. She is very unstable and egomaniac, but she is funny and loyal, so I adored her.As I said before, every element in the story is developed with great care, but I was a bit confused at first. The author doesn&#8217;t give any warning that several decades have passed from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2, and the introduction of the main characters within the first chapters is a little forced. They just appear. After that I began to get a hold of the story and thoroughly enjoyed it.Finally, I will add that the story is told from the points of view of at least three different characters. I love more than one point of view in a book, and I think the author did a good job, but even though I didn&#8217;t get confused, maybe more distracted readers could.I found a few typos, but nothing too bad.Overall this book is fun, engaging, and well written and I enjoyed it a lot. I easily got sucked into it and will definitely be reading the next books in the series. I&#8217;m dying to know what happens next and how things will unfold.*Note: I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review, but my opinion was not biased in any way by this fact. </p>

 <p> This book surpassed anything I could have expected. I love mythology and with this book being a bit of mythology and a bit of a girl's fight to understand herself and her family, made this book a book that must be read by itself and also made it one of the books I will highly recommend to many people. I just finished it yesterday and already wrote down the information for a friend who has a Kindle.  I couldn't put it down. You want to know what happens next.  A must have for my collection. When this comes out in Paperback I will probably get myself a copy too!!!! </p>
