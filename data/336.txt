 <p> I'm new to PSP and the whole layout of PSP is new to me. This book is a necessity. I'm still reading it, but it's easy to ready, lots of pictures and tips. If you're new to PSP you probably need to buy some book and this is a good one. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> After recently purchasing Corel paint Shop Pro Photo X3 I found that all the menu choices were confusing and overwhelming. I bought the book as a guide even though it was written for Photo X2 instead of X3. Now I am able to get started on some of the features of the software that I wanted most. With a thourough table of contents in the beginning of the book, you can easily find the pages with answers to your Questions. </p>

 <p> If your looking for something that rivals Elements at a great price you just found it. And it works with Vista. Great editing tools. Easy to work with. You will love this product. </p>

 <p> I have Paint Shop Pro x2 but I had no clue how to work with most of the program's features. This book explains how to do everything I wanted to know how to do. It's marvelous. I thank Diane Koers for an excellently written book for someone like me who needs clear step-by-step instructions. </p>

 <p> I'm still trying to learn all the in's and out's of this program, and it does do a LOT of things.  I did get a manual with the product and bought a book to go with it also, both are helpful.  As are a number of my friends who also use this version.It's a bargain for the price and performs flawlessly with my Vista Home Premium 64bit OS. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Disappointed </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I just received this book and started to go through it searching for several subjects and techniques on how to do things with Photo X2 and was disappointed to discover that there is nothing in the book regarding what I was looking for.  Maybe it is there and I have to search for it but it is not in the chapter list nor in the index.  Photo X2 has a tool for HDR photography, that is High Dynamic Range pictures which involves shooting a scene using 3 different camera settings then blending the 3 photos into one picture.  While I am familiar with HDR I was hoping that I would find more info in this book.  This lack of information makes me wonder what else is missing from this book.  This is my second book on Photo X2 and it was purchased because of the attached CD-ROM which I hope will give me the information I am looking for.  We shall see.  Bottom line, I would not have purchased this book had I known it was lacking in being a complete how-to manual on Photo X2. </p>

 <p> a well written book well explained for the use of all the different commands but i already use adobe photoshop and all these programms are similar and it helps a lot when it comes to use a different one. For a real beginner it is may be a lot harder but still useful </p>
