 <p> 80-76%-perfect75-71%-awsome70-66%-good65-61%-poor60-56%-awful1. Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton- This was a goo dmatch to kick off the show> they did about the same job here as they did at vengence. I think that both of these guys could have borught better than this becuase at times it seemed like this amcth was a little slow for my liking. Picked up near he end not as many near falls but a nice counter by orton which leads to a rko and a 1 2 3. Winner randy orton. Match Rating 7/10.2. Umaga vs. Eugene- this was what i thought it was going to be a squash match. Not good at all and i dont know why the wwe is trying to push umaga. I am happy that umaga won this match just becuase if eugene won i would have killed myself. Umaga has one thing going for him and that is his manger. He is funny. Winner umaga. Match Rating 3/10.3. Rick Flair vs. Mick Foley 2 out of 3 falls- This was not what i was expecting this to be. Usually when i see a 2 out of 3 falls match there is always a third fall. This was not that good of a wrestling match. i give it to foley he was one of the craziest people i ever saw but when it came to a technical wrestling match he could not do it. Also flair can still wreslte but not the same back in the 80s. this had a bad ending but it wil proboly continue there fued thorughout the summer. Winner Rick Flair. Match Rating 6/10.4. Shelton Benjamin vs. Jonny Nitro vs. Carlito for the itc title- This was an awsome match. The people i was watching this with said the could care less about this when it was one of the best matches on this card. This was played out beatiful. Carlito started out with some high flying moves whcih was cool. Also there was one point in this match were all three men went to the top rope and there was a powerebomb german suplex off the top rope. Very good match. Winner and new wwe itc champ Jonny nitro. match Rating 8.5/10.5. Rvd vs. Edge for the wwe title- This is what should have been the main event. This in my opion was the match of the night. It seemed like the crowd was confused that this was not the main event. Anyway this was an awsome wrestling match. There were nice moves as a crossbody jumping over the top rope and a sunsetflip over the top rope. Also near the end edge took and sick running chair shot to the head. Also lots of near fall makes for the match of the night. WInner and still wwe champ RVD. Match rating 9/10.6. Kane vs. Imposter Kane- This was your typical big man match. It was a little  less excitning. this seemed like a filler but it accualty had a storyline. Not much to say but not that exciting and i dont know were kane goes from here. Winner Imposter Kane. Match rating 5.5/10.7. Sabu vs. John Cena in an extreme lumberjack match- This was a good match. i would have liked to seen this be given more than just 10 minutes. It was very fast pace and i liked the idea of the lumberjacks but i wished that it would have been a one on one hardcore match. Sick part in htius match were cena  F-Ued sabu through a table. Winner John Cena. match Rating 8/10.8. Dx vs. The Spirt Squad in a 5-2 handicap match- I at first was wondering why the hell is this the mani event instead of thw wwe title. This started out bad but got alot better when they accualty started wrestling. Good soild work shown by everyone here and a sick chair shot to HHH was given during this match. Also a funny part at the end were Micky kissed HHH butt. Winners DX. match Rating 8/10.Well that raps up another. I would give Vengence 2006 a grade of 55/80 which is a 69% which means this is a good ppv. That is about right not as good as last years but you have some upo matches with the wwe title cena sabu and the triple thret and dx and than u have umaga kane and the foley match which were a little dissapointing. Overal worth my money. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not i would appreicate that. thanks for your time. </p>

 <p> While this PPV was the return of D-X, it did feature a few other good matches. It was the only time to see RVD wrestle a PPV as the champion. The only problem I had was too many backstage skits ran too long and made the show kind of like Raw in a way.Kurt Angle VS Randy Orton: A very good opening match. I love how Orton can pull the RKO out of nowheres.Eugene VS Umaga: Hate Eugene and its a damn shame Umaga didnt destory Eugene.Mick Foley vs Ric Flair: This was in Flair's hometown. If that doesnt give the match away, then I dont know what will. The match itself was a bore and they'd go onto have a better match at Summerslam.Shelton Benjamin VS Johnny Nitro VS Carlito: Best match on the whole card. Its too bad Benjamin and Carlito arent doing anything important in the WWE right now. The only downside to this match was the ending sucked.RVD VS Edge: A good match but nothing speical. Oh wait, its the only WWE ppv you'll ever see RVD as a champion. Like one reviewer said, this match was stuck in the middle? I know D-X was the seller of the show but the other two matches sucked.Kane VS Imposter Kane: A storyline that disappeared. Imposter Kane wins a very boring match. Imposter Kane is not Festus Dalton on Smackdown if anyone really cared.Sabu VS John Cena: ECW is made to look like fools for the WWE crowd. If this was the real ECW, Sabu would have won. Sabu does his usual stuff but its always fun to watch. Very good moments in this match but Cena won of course.DX VS Sprirt Squad: The Squad won this match...yea right. DX returns and destorys the Squad. A decent match but I wouldnt say it was the best of the reunion tour.Overall, this PPV was good. A few matches stunk. The extras are on disc 2 are alright but nothing new if you own the New and Improved D-X dvd. </p>

 <p> Vengeance 2206 Predictions </p>


<h2> review.date </h2>
  09-22-2006  
<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Just like last year, Vengence was a RAW event that was heavily booked two weeks before the PPV (due to ECW One Night Stand) however unlike last year (where it resulted in a WrestleMania quality card), this years event just came off like a 3 hour version of RAW with alot of matches & angles that weren't worth the price of Pay Per View.  And I'm warning you right now that Jerry Lawler spends more time bashing ECW in their matches than actually calling the match & is more annoying than he is during a divas match so if you can't stand that then I suggest you press the mute button.Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton - In a rematch from One Night Stand, these two went at it again and it almost exactly mirrored their match from One Night Stand (minus the crowd being all over Orton).  It was a nice match & Orton got the win in the end.Eugene Vs Umaga - Glorified squash match as Umaga killed Eugene followed by taking out Doink The Clown & Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  But after that, Umaga left when Kamala confronted him (but that didn't lead anywhere as Umaga squashed him the next night on RAW).  I'm no fan of squash matches on PPV so this match could have been saved for RAW.Ric Flair Vs Mick Foley (2 out of 3 falls): They actually do wrestle each other until Flair scores the first pinfall in around 7 mins. and then Foley completely goes hardcore on Flair & bloodies Flair; disqualifing himself in the process.  Again, for all the hype (not just the two week buildup but years worth of hype) and it just ends a little after 7 mins.  This again was something that should have happened on RAW, not a PPV.Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin Vs Johnny Nitro Vs Carlito - The PPV stars to pick up here again as these two pulled off a great match.  Shelton is one of the most underrated (based on how he's used from time to time), Carlito is finally coming into his own as a wrestler & not a comedy act, while Nitro is out to prove he can make it as a singles star.  Again, it's not a wrestling mat classic but it's an awesome match to watch.WWE Champion RVD Vs Edge - Their styles really compliment each other & give another great match to watch.  Match of the night for me.Kane Vs Imposter Kane - This match wasn't ugly or bad, it was just a boring "big man vs. big man" match.  Want to know how boring this match is, they killed the character & the storyline the next night on RAW.Extreme Lumberjack Match: John Cena Vs Sabu - First of all, it's no secret that Stephanie McMahon (head of creative for RAW & SmackDown) is no fan of ECW & that was heavily reflected in his match as the ECW originals were lumberjacks (no Big Show or Angle) and were made to look inferior to the Sunday Night Heat roster (Rob Conway, Charlie Hass, ect.) throughout the match.  And course, Lawler making a bunch of "Extremely Crappy Wrestling" comments & even J.R. joining in on it from time didn't help the match any as well.  But besides all of that, this match was good for what it was.  It was basically both men getting their traditional spots in a 10 min. match with Sabu tapping out (FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS CAREER) to Cena.Spirit Squad Vs DX - Unlike their Saturday Night Main Event match the next month where it was a complete squash, this was really good with a mix of wrestling & some humorious spots every now & then.  The Squad still looked somewhat strong throughout the match but they were just bodies for the DX reunion to go on strong.There is also a bonus disc full of extras such as the behind the scenes of Torrie's magazine photo shoot, Mick Foley meeting Melina, Edge & Ric Flair interviews along with the RVD vs. Cena rematch from RAW the next night.  The rest are all the DX skits from the previous & following weeks including the Handicap match between Triple H & Spirit Squad, Spirit Squad being slimed, DX giving gifts to Mr. McMahon & hanging out with Coach, the official DX reunion, the new & updated DX music video, and the McMahon impersonations leading to Vince & Shane & Spirit Squad getting showered in "holy" sh*t!Bottom line is that Vengence is a strong RAW PPV but three of these matches were complete duds & really killed the crowd & the good flow of the PPV.  The extras were a nice additional touch & hope WWE concidered that for future releases as well. </p>

 <p> DX + ECW = Good RAW PPV but Could Have Been Better </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> After taking a break from watching WWE that lasted roughly four years (2002 onwards), I recently bought a whole bunch of WWE PPVs to catch up a little. Now, I wasn't crazy about the ones I got (Summerslam 2005 especially), but boy oh boy was this Vengeance an eye- opener. WWE seems to be in really bad shape, but more later, let me have a little summary of the matches first.The opener between Kurt Angle and Randy Orton was average. They don't seem to harmonise very well, their match seriously lacked coherence. There was one good spot where Angle pulled off eight German suplexes in a row. Apart from that, nothing memorable happened. The ending looked forced.Then we are forced to watch Eugene vs. Umaga. Now there are 10 minutes of my life I won't get back. No hard feelings, I have nothing against some well- placed, senseless humor in a PPV, it lightens things up, but this was just stupid, pointless, embarassing. It was apparently meant to underline Umaga's power, but failed big way.At this point, pause your DVD, close your eyes, and think about the great matches Ric Flair and Mick Foley gave us. Flair Vs. Savage, Flair Vs. Triple H, Flair Vs. Hogan, Foley Vs. The Rock, Foley Vs. The Undertaker ... then push "Play" and watch the next 5 minutes of gigantic dissapointment, known as Ric Flair Vs. Mick Foley. Oh, with 2 out of 3 ruling, by the way. Not that it matters. For god's sake, if you have such a ruling, USE IT! Everyone knows that after the 1-0, a 1-1 has to follow to create tension. This kind of match has created dozens of fantastic battles. But this is over literally after 5 minutes!This is a pure waste of a fan's time and anticipation.Shelton Benjamin Vs. Johnny Nitro Vs. Carlito for the IC title is by far the best match of the evening. Hands down. Good, fast, well- flowing match with a couple of really exciting moments. Nitro and Carlito are two promising newcomers.RVD Vs Edge was ... well, let me put it this way: had it been for the IC title, it would have been good. The match itself was indeed nice, but seeing these two fighting for the WWE title doesn't sit well. What qualifies Edge to be a WWE champion? What qualifies RVD? That they have been in this sport for more than 10 years?Kane vs. Importer Kane wasn't even a rehash of Undertaker Vs. Undertaker, it was the rehash of a rehash of a questionable idea. That being said, seeing these two going at each other was actually pretty freaky. And THAT being said, I wouldn't watch it again.The John Cena Vs. Sabu Lumberjack Extreme Rules match was as much a disgrace to its origins as the 2 out of 3 falls match earlier. A crash through a table and some moves with a chair doesn't make a match ECW- style. Every TLC match between the Hardy Boys and Edge and Christian from earlier times (god bless them) was more ECW than this.By the way, this charade also lasted merely 5 minutes.Now to the main ev ... wait, already? But we haven't seen anything memorable so far, this better be good!So, the DX is back, huh? I sure hope this doesn't turn out to be as much a parody of itself as the "2 out of 3 falls" and "Extreme Rules" matches.But it does. Triple H and Shawn Michaels give a little speech before the actual match, but instead of saying anything really funny or witty, they just bellow out their usual catchphrases.The Spirit Squad is really a damn stupid idea, but they are unquestionably funny. More funny than the DX itself in this match, actually.Triple H and Michaels aren't the DX, they are playing the DX, and that does make one hell of a difference.Where are we at with this PPV? What does it do, where is its place in the long, glorious history of WWE/WWF PPVs? I don't know, but it's got to be somewhere at the rock bottom. WWE needs ideas, and it needs them badly. SO badly. Not so long ago, I didn't like the way they treated Chris Jericho. Today I would kill to see him back in the ring.This whole Vengeance PPV feels like watching some strange revival show.Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Doink, Kamala, Mick Foley, Kane Vs. Kane ... and Ric Flair. He's the greatest performer who ever lived, but please! PLEASE, Ric, if you want to continue to wrestle, Get.In.Shape! It looks like Foley is beating up just a really old, wrinkly guy.And the DX won't survive very long, believe me. It will suffer the fate of the nWo. It won't take very long until Triple H and Shawn Michaels will face each other.The only consolation can be that after great lows, there are usually great heights.Please, wrestling fans, open your eyes! I've never seen TNA, but it can't be any worse than *this*! </p>

 <p> 1. Kurt Angle vs Randy Orton- A good rematch from ECW One Night Stand. Another technical match as expected. Not as good as One Night Stand but definately a good match. 8/102. Umaga vs Eugene- Another squash. I can't believe what I heard on a website. Umaga is gonna win the wwe title at Summerslam!?!! I hope this is not true because he is not championship material in my opinion. Anyway nothing special in this match. 3/103. Mick Foley vs Ric Flair- I am very dissapointed in this match. They were hyping this match to be very good. They could've made 1 match single competition 2nd match street fight and 3rd match a cage match or something like that. That would've been way better.  This match was a big letdown and the ending really doesn't help the rating. 5/104. Triple Threat Match- Wow! A very good match and one of the best triple threats I've seen. Carlito really impressed me in this match and he done some impressive moves. A great match and the best match thus far. 9/105. Edge vs RVD- An excellent title match that never got boring. Some sick bumps taken by RVD. A suprising ending in my opinion and probably for everyone. I thought Edge was gonna win but now I think Cena could win at SNME. 9.5/106. Kane vs Imposter Kane- A boring, big man style type of match. I hope this storyline is ending soon and I agree with a wrestling columnist when he said that Kane has had the worst storylined out of any wrestler. 4/107. Sabu vs John Cena- A nice ECW style match. It was kinda short. It was fast paced throughout and it was good in the time given. Some sick chair spots. This match along with RVD and Cena from One Night Stand shows how homecourt advantage helps a lot. 8.5/108. DX vs Spirit Squad- A good match but it is not really main event material. It was good but it could be a nice midcard match or the match before the main event. RVD and Edge should've been the main event. DX is looking good and are better than ever. 8/1-A good raw ppv and it is worth a buy. 5 matches are worth checking out. DX!! </p>

 <p> I have to say that if you want to get a WWE DVD this year thats worth watching the whole thing, this is a definate one of the must have. Now granted there are 2 matches that are...ok, but all in all a great PPV.Angle Vs Orton: great match. these two work great together and a definate good match.Eugene Vs Umaga: an ok match, i mean we all knew Umaga was going to win, but its interesting to see what Eugene can pull out (which wasn't much).Flair Vs Foley (2 out of 3 falls): a pretty good match from the beginning and you can tell that foley can do some technical mat wrestling (we've seen it in the past mixed with his brawling). When flair won the first fall it was pretty much the end of the match since foley went right back to what he knows best and loses by DQ, then bludgeons flair. could of been much better but wasn't too bad.Benjamin Vs Nitro Vs Carlito (IC match): a really good match. one of the top matches ranked up there with the orton/angle match. a defiante must see.RVD Vs Edge (WWE title): a really good match! these two guys styles compliment each other very well and it shows in this great match. an interesting ending as well and another must see match.Kane Vs Imposter Kane: No offense, but this was no Undertaker Vs Fake Undertaker which it seemed like they were doing. Just didn't have the feel of that match. It was a good idea to try and do but just seemed like it was done all wrong. A decent big guys match but really the crowd wasn't feeling it and honestly, the real Kane just seemed unmotivated to do anything in this match which disappoints. If it was handled differently, this would of been good (imagine fake taker and fake kane vs undertaker and kane.... it'd be like fake diesel and ramon going against nash and hall.... c'mon you all know you wanted to see that just for the humor factor).Cena Vs Sabu (Lumberjack Extreme Rules match): a really good match than you would figure it to be. I say that cause in most lumberjack matches we've seen in the past all the lumberjacks storm the ring. this one they don't and besides some outside activities, it stays a one on one match. weapons are nicely used here and well, Cena shows his extreme side. a definate must see.Spirit Squad Vs DX (5 vs 2 non title match): ok its DX so its a money maker match :) yes it is good too so no worries about a lousy match as you will both laugh and see some nice moves in this one. a definate must see just for the humor factor as well as some great action.a bonus dvd is included with extras such as the reformation of Dx and some antics from them as of late. There is also the WWE title match between cena and RVD thats the night after the PPV and a few other spots as well. A definate must get so get a copy as soon as you can! </p>

 <p> Randy Orton vs Kurt Angle: Orton won this one like I expected he would since Angle beat him 2 times with the ankle lock. It still was a very good match though. I don't understand why Angle and Orton had to wrestle first just so the Spirit Squard could be in the mainevent though. Anyway Angle dominates most the match and Orton wins by hitting Angle's face on an exposed turn-buckle and then hits the RKO for the win.8 out of 10Umaga vs Eugene: Eugene comes out with Doink, Hacksaw and Kamala and still loses very quickly to that taped thumb move. Umaga then beats up Hacksaw and Doink but his manager wouldn't let him fight Kamala. I guess just to set up Umaga to beat him in a quick match too.4 out of 10Mick Foley vs Ric Flair (2 out of 3 Falls): Flair win the first fall with a roll-up pin and then wins the 2nd fall by DQ when Foley shoves the ref. Then Foley goes all hardcore and makes Flair bleed bad. Younger and quicker guys in a 2 out of 3 fall match would've been much better than this.6 out of 10Johny Nitro vs Carlito vs Shelton Benjaman: A good match with a lot of action with Nitro taking advantage of Carlito doing all the work on Benjaman to get the win. It's funny how he and Melina were supposed to get suspended for being rude backstage on Smackdown. Then they got pushed to Raw and now Nitro gets a IC title push that he's not even ready for. When poor Joey Mercury hasn't even been on TV since M&M; broke up. The wrong man won but still not a bad match.7 out of 10Edge vs RVD (World title): Yes this match happened before Kane vs Kane, Sabu vs Cena and DX vs the Spirit Squard! RVD won the World title and is still a mid-carder at ppvs, this guy never gets a break. Since he pinned Edge at the ECW show this week I expected Edge to win. RVD picks up the win though in an impressive match for both men. They reverse a lot of each others moves. RVD picks up the win with the 5 Star Frog Splash after RVD moves out of the way of the spear and Edge hits a chair Lita has heaald up. Edge lost just so that wannabe rapper that gets thrown in our face constantly can win the belt from RVD on Raw tomorrow night, woo hoo....not! This match was better than the matches that followed it, so it could've easily have been the last match.10 out of 10Fake Kane vs Kane: Since it's obvious that they want to put over the new Kane it was obvious he was going to win this match. He wasn't that impressive at all though. The real Kane destroys him through most the match and fake Kane wins with a weak Chokeslam.5 out of 10.Sabu vs John Cena (Extreme Lumberjack match): This match just made ECW look weak and that is why the WWE can't do ECW if their lives counted on it!! Guys that you hardly see on tv came out to represent Raw in Cena's corner. While any of them could've made things more exciting by turning on Cena and jumping to ECW. I mean Val Venis in his Pornstar gimmick in ECW would be much much better than Zombies!!! Sabu is one of the only guys in the new but anything but improved ECW that can go and they make him look weak here by losing to the played out and get the hell out of our face already John Cena. Just so we can hear Lawyler say " he sure showed those Extremely crappy wrestlers!". Or hear J.R. try to put over Cena by talking about how great he is when he's really not. Sabu didn't tap-out to the Samoan sabmission Machine Samoa Joe yet he tapped out to John Cena ?? If they wanted to make him and ECW look strong they could've at least have Sabu be in the STFU for a few minutes and pass-out. Instead they're making all the same mistakes they did in the Alliance angle, they are more concerned with making the WWE guys look strong. I would much much rather see Sabu in the ring with Rey again instead of Cena.5 out of 10The Spirit Squard vs DX: RVD waited years to be champ just so he can be a mid-carder at a ppv and then probably just lose the belt back to Cena on Raw. Plus the Spirit Squard can go but come on, are they really ppv mainevent worthy ?? I like Triple H as face but he really needs to realize that he's not the only guy on Raw that can be a mainevent at a Raw ppv. RVD vs Edge could've easily have been the last match. This match wasn't bad but it could've easily have just been the mainevent on an episode of Raw. Plus after HHH being evil for so long it doesn't work that he acts all goofy now. I expected him to even turn-on Michaels. No though, HBK gets beat up through most the match and then makes the tag to HHH. They beat-up the Spirit Squard and hit Sweet Chin Music on one member and the Pedigree on another for the win. HHH then pulls down his pants and HBK shoves one of the Spirit Squard members faces up there.8 out of 10 </p>

 <p> Angle vs. OrtonA good match, however wasn't as good as it could have been. I still get this feeling that these 2 could really have a great match but are currently just having good matches.RATING: 82/100Kane vs. KaneThis match was not shown in SA (probably to save time) so I cannot rate it.Umaga vs. EugeneTerrible short 1 minute squash. Plus I hate Umaga's finisher. I may be too generous with this ratingRATING: 40/100Foley vs. FlairThis match was decently good (mainly in the beginning) but wasn't as good as it could have been if the match went a bit longer with Foley also get a fall victory. I hope they face again in a match that suits Foley more.RATING: 78/100Benjamin vs. Nitro vs. CarlitoBrilliant IC title match. It exceeded my expectations big time as it just had so many shows of athleticism by mainly Carlito and Benjamin. It is unfortunate that the person that brought the least to the match leaves with the title but we just can't help that.RATING: 89/100Edge vs. RVDThis match was another very good match that also had many great shows of athleticism. Many momentum changes and a good ending. I believe this match should have been the main event and if for some reason not, at least the second last match.RATING: 90/100Cena vs. SabuThis match had some very good spots but it just wasn't long enough. It was also pretty similar to their previous match from WWE vs. ECW (give or take the lumberjacks). Pretty much the same length as well makes this match slightly short (perhaps 5 minutes) for my liking.RATING: 83/100DX vs. Spirit SquadInteresting choice as the main event considering it is a tag match with no titles on the line. But still a tag match better than most and did what it had to do. Damn do I love DX?!RATING: 80/100543/700 = 78%overall Impression = 78%78% - The 2006 version of Vengeance continues the trend of a brilliant PPV for the second year running. It was a packed card that didn't disappoint. Out of what I saw, for only 2 matches out of the whole PPV to fail to get an 80 or above truly is a great achievement. Great follow up to ECW One Night Stand!SUCK IT! </p>

THE MATCH STARTED WITH ANGLE USING HIS TECHNICAL WRESTLING SKILLS TO GROUND AND ANGER ORTON. ONE OF THE REASON THIS MATCH WAS NOT AS GOOD AS ECW'S IS BECAUSE OF THE CROWD INVOLVMENT. AT ECW THE CROWD WAS COMPLETEKY LIVE THE WHOLE MATCH. IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY HERE. ALSO THE ENDING TOOK AWAY FROM THE MATCH, WHERE ANGLE RAN INTO THE EXPOSED TURNBUCKLE, FOLLOWED BY AN RKO. BUT OVERALL, IT WAS STILL A DECENT WRESTLING MATCH.WINNER: RANDY ORTONRATING: 6UMAGA VS. EUGENEAS YOU WOULD EXPECT, THIS WAS A SQUASH. UNDER 2 MINUTES LONG, THIS WAS NOT WELL PUT TOGETHER.

I KNOW BOTH MEN CAN GET THE JOB DONE SEPERATELY, BUT NOT HOW THE WOULD MIX TOGETHER. WHAT WE GOT WAS A SHORT AND AVERAGE MATCH. WOULD HAVE PROBABLY FAILED IF NOT FOR THE SICK AFTERMATH, WHERE MICK GETS DQD AFTER A TRASH CAN SHOT, FOLLOWED BY A BRUTAL BEATDOWN, INCLUDING BLOODING RIC WITH A BARBED WIRE BAT.

CARLITO CONTINUES TO USE HIS NEW HIGHFLYING MOVESET, WHILE SHELTON USES HIS GREAT WRESTLING SKILLS, AND NITRO BEING, WELL, NITRO. THERE WAS A NICE SPOT WITH THE TOWER OF DOOM, THAT THREE MAN BACKBODY DROP AND SUPERPLEX, WHICH GOT A BIG CROWD REACTION. BUT, THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH THE MATCH IS THE ENDING. CARLITO HAD IT WON WITH THE BACKCRACKER ON SHELTON, FOLLOWED BY NITRO STEALING THE WIN BY PINNING SHELTON. BUT THAT DOESNT TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM A GREAT MATCH.WINNER: JOHNNY NITRORATING: 8WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHROB VAN DAM VS. EDGETHIS WAS BAD BOOKING IN MY MIND. HOW IS THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH THE FIFTH ON A FULL CARD OF EIGHT MATCHES? THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MAIN EVENT. THIS MATCH COULD BE COMPARED TO THE IC TITLE MATCH. THE WRESTLING WAS GREAT, AS BOTH MEN SEEMED TO STEP UP THEIR GAME. THESE TWO HAVE HAD A FEW GOOD MATCHES BEFORE, BUT THIS ONE WAS WAS TIED FAVORITE ALONG WITH THEIR HARDCIRE TITLE MATCH, BACK IN NOVEMBER 2001, WHERE TEST SCREWED EDGE. BOTH MEN DID SOME NICE HIGHFLYING MOVES, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. ROB VAN DAM RETAINS THE TITLE AFTER A FIVE STAR FROG SPLASH.WINNER: ROB VAN DAMRATING: 8KANE VS. IMPOSTER KANETHIS WAS YOUR TYPICAL BIG MAN MATCH. MAYBE BELOW AVERAGE. IF YOU DIDNT KNOW, THE IMPOSTER KANE IS THE FREAKIN DEACON FROM OVW. I DONT THINK THE KANE'S MIXED WELL.

JOHN CENATHIS WAS THE HARDCORE MATCH OF THE NIGHT. BUT SADLY, IT WAS ONLY GIVEN AROUND SEVEN MINUTES. THIS WAS STILL A SWEET MATCHUP, WITH THE LUMBERJACKS GETTING INVOLVED. INCLUDING A SANDMAN SINGAPORE CANE SHOT TO CENA, BEFORE TOSSING HIM IN THE RING. AROUND THE SIX MINUTE MARK, CENA HITS AN FU ON SABU OVER THE TOP ROPE THROUGH A TABLE, WHICH WAS A NICE SPOT. BUT SUDDENLY IT QUICKLY ENDS WITH CENA MAKING SABU TAP TO THE FU. POOR ENDING TO A GOOD MATCH, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME IT WAS GIVEN.WINNER: JOHN CENARATING: 7.55 ON 2 HANDICAP MATCHDX VS. SPIRIT SQUADTHIS WAS AN ABOVE AVERAGE HANDICAP MATCH. IT WAS ENTERTAINING, AND THERE WAS SOME GOOD WRSETLING MOVES USED. BUT THE ONE PROBLEM IS THAT IT DID NOT DESERVE TO BE THE MAIN EVENT. I'D UNDERSTAND THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH BEING THE MAIN EVENT, EVEN THE SABU VS. CENA MATCH. BUT A HANDICAP MATCH? I WAS HOPING THAT DX WOULD EXPAND TO BEING A STABLE, BUT I GUESS WWE IS KEEPING THE A NORMAL TAG TEAM, WHICH IS STILL OKAY. DESPITE THS BAD BOOKING, THE MATCH ITSELF WAS GOOD, AND WAS A NICE RETURN FOR DX.WINNERS: DXRATING: 7WWE VENGEANCE 2006 - (59.5/80) 74%WWE VENGEANCE 2006 RECEIVES AN OVERALL (B+) GRADE, MEAINING IT WAS A VERY GOOD PAY PER VIEW. I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD, AS THERE WERE TWO AWESOME MATCHES, TWO BAD MATCHES, AND FOUR MATCHES THAT WERE DECENT TO VERY GOOD. ONCE AGAIN A GOOD PAY PER VIEW BY WWE. THERE IS ALSO OVER AN HOUR OF EXTRAS ON THE BONUS DISC, INCLUDING TWO MATCHES, ALL OF THE DX AND MCMAHON SEGMENTS FROM RAW THE NEXT DAY, AND A WHOLE LOT MORE. THOUGH THERE ARE TWO BAD MATCHES, THE REST ARE DEFINATELY WORTH WATCHING. THE VENGEANCE PAY PER VIEW ITSELF DESERVES FOUR STARS, BUT WITH THE 75 MINUTES OF EXTRAS, THE DVD ITSELF IS WORTH ABOUT 4 1/2, GREAT DVD EFFORT FROM WWE. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED. </p>

 <p> Was it just me or did the crowed at this show really suck? It felt so boring to watch with the crowed actualy sitting there bored stupid yelling out, "boring" during the Kane VS Kane match.Nothing seemed to be resolved, and I dont think most of the wrestlers where up to PPV standards. They wrestle better then everynight on raw.The opening round with Angle VS Orton I got bored with and skipped.Umaga VS Eugene looked like it was going to be a cool macth when Eugene brought out Doink The Clown, Hacksaw Jim Duggan and Kamala, but the whole thing ended up totaly wrong and not worth watching.Rick Flair VS Foley was not the match I expected to see from those two.Skipped the triple threat f**sRVD vs Edge: EuhhKane VS Kane: what was that all about?John Cena vs Sabu: I tried to watch it but skipped to the end.DX vs Spirit sqaud.... too expected and predicatble.I was not impressed with this PPV at all. The wrestlers didnt seem to give it there all and the crowed where just not into it. Matches didnt go the way they should have and it all seemed to be like watching a regular show, most of it was just a set up for the next night on Raw.I give the PPV 2 stars.But on the plus side, the second disc of extras is great. It's mostly the reunion of DX footage. Apart from the following nights match of RVD and Cena and Mick Foley and Rick Flair cuts, its pretty much all DX.It shows DX up to some funny antics on Mr McMahon and the Coach. There parody of the spirit sqaud and parody of Shane and Vince McMahon, there reunion speech, and the night they let the s*** hit the fan on the boss.The second disc left me more satasfied and entertained then the actual ppv. The PPV was very slow and boring with hardly any momentom going for anyone. Which is disapointing, it couldve been a great show otherwise.I give the second disc 4 stars! I'd been happier if they just released it as a DX reunion with the PPV as the bonus features. </p>

 <p> 1.Raw's Randy Orton vs ECW's Kurt Angle 6/10not a good bout simply because of the similarity to their other 2 matches they didn't but their all into it so it's just decent.2. Umaga vs Eugene 2/10 squash match that was just pointless who hasn't beat eugene.3.2 out of 3 falls match Ric Flair vs Mick Foley foley 6/10 had it right what a stinkeroo it just shows you foley is a glorified stuntman but i still respect him.This match came out of nowhere though and wasn't good4.Triple Threat Match for the ic title Shelton Benjamen vs Carlito vs Johnny Nitro 8.5/10 vengeance will always be famous for triple threat matches including this one an almost perfect match but all I can say is that the wrong man won.5.WWE/ECW Title match ECW's RVD vs Raw's Edge 9.5/10 MATCH OF THE NIGHT!!! Man what a great match these guys were on the top of their game but why isn't this the main event or the match before seeing that this ppv was based on dx's return but the 5th out of 8 matches man that sucks but this match proves the edge and rvd are 2 of the top guys in this great sport.6.Kane vs "Kane" 5/10 a big man with talent vs a big man with no talent7.Extreme Lumberjack Match ECW's Sabu vs Raw's John Cena 7.5/10 Bottomline cena sucks but it's a good match sabu carried cena in this one but it just looks like a match from raw not on a ppv be cause im not sure but i beleive that this is the first lumberjack match on a ppv8.DX vs The Sprit Squad 9/10 a fun match and funny dx is great and sprit squad are great too.overall 8.5/10 a fun vengeance that will always be remembered some matches should have not been on the card but that's ok I advise you to buy this when it comes out. </p>

 <p> In 2006, I would've told you to pick up this 3-star PPV because the 2nd disc had a lot of DX bonuses, and a couple of excellent matches.In 2007, I would've told you to still pick this set up because even though the DX extras got released on the NEW & IMPROVED DX set, there were still a couple irresistible matches on the card.It's 2009, and with the exception of my favorite match of 2006, there's little reason to invest in VENGEANCE 2006.  There's a lot of content on this 2-disc set, but the quality is debateable.1) Randy Orton (RAW) v. Kurt Angle (ECW)---I didn't see these two wrestlers work together much, but I've been disappointed every time.  Their WRESTLEMANIA triple threat was 10 minutes of awesomeness that ended way sooner than it should've.  Their encounter at the ECW's official brand launch was basically Angle embarassing Orton like you wouldn't believe.  But this one has no excuse.  Angle and Orton, quite frankly, just meandered around in a slow-paced match that failed to draw me in.  There were a couple of teased spots that never came to be, specifically Angle attempting a German suplex off the apron.  I love both of these guys, but I just can't into their one-on-one matches."5.5 / 10"_______________________________________________2) Umaga v. Eugene---Basically a chance for Umaga to squash a gimmick that overstayed his welcome.  I would normally get furious at these stupid squashes, but I didn't expect much to begin with, so I'm indifferent.  Some people would ask, "Well, then why bother at all on PPV?"  Those people have a good point."4.0 / 10"_______________________________________________3) Two-Out-of-Three FallsMick Foley v. Ric Flair---This is another shameful jip.  Foley couldn't have done a better job turning heel.  Flair and Foley pushed their somewhat real-life dislike for each other into a compelling storyline.  We were in North Carolina, and Foley thankfully retracted his promise to deliver the worst wrestling match of all time.  If it weren't for the crowd's generous reception to the short contest that basically prolonged the storyline, then this would've tanked even harder.  The match is entertaining while it lasts, but it just stops when it was getting good."5.5 / 10"_______________________________________________4) Intercontinental ChampionshipCarlito v. Johnny Nitro v. Shelton Benjamin (champion)---I love how this match starts; Carlito is watching two Divas oil each other, and is almost tempted to not go out the ring when his music starts in the background.  Nitro was new the RAW roster, and Shelton Benjamin can do any physical feat he wants.  The match starts a little strange, because it's basically the three guys performing what are obviously choreographed spots.  But then the spots just get so crazy and so crisp that you stop caring go along for the ride.  The crowd was stunned at what they witnessed, going from one exciting move to the next.  This match was rightfully included on the HISTORY OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP DVD.  Too bad for this 2-disc set."8.5 / 10"_______________________________________________5) WWE ChampionshipEdge (RAW) v. Rob Van Dam (ECW - WWE champion & ECW champion)---First off, why is this match in the middle of the card?  I accept it not being the main event (DX would've stolen all of the pops anyway), but this is just wrong.  Anyway, this extraordinary match is why I almost recommend you buy this PPV.  The crowd didn't get into the match right away, but Edge and RVD were throwing counter after counter, hold after hold, signature moves, false finishes...just about anything you want in a title match, really.  The match starts off patiently, so that Edge and RVD can size each other up.  But as the match endures, the two men get desperate and pull out all the stops to put away their opponent.  Not all championships need to be like this one, but they're usually the best when they are.  I'm disappointed that Edge didn't get to have this match on his 3-disc set, because even though he got pinned to the mat, RVD and Edge delivered my favorite match from 2006."9.0 / 10"_______________________________________________6) Kane v. "Kane"---Man, Kane was in some weird angles in 2006.  The "May 19th" voices in his head to plug his horror movie.  An endless feud with Umaga later in the year.  But this one bites the big one; when have "mirror" matches ever worked?  Oddly enough, even though this was a stupid storyline, the physical action between the two Kanes was kinda entertaining to me.  If you can ignore the "Boring" chants and bizarre scenario, this is a decent slugfest between two large athletes.  A waste of time, but I didn't think it was as awful as most have made it out to be."6.0 / 10"_______________________________________________7) Extreme Lumberjack MatchSabu (ECW) v. John Cena (RAW)---Remember when ECW just launched, and was doing fairly well for itself?  The tension between RAW's "superstars" and ECW's "extremists" was some very good TV.  This interpromotional match was built well enough to earn high spot on the card (not over RVD/Edge, but whatever).  And to be fair, the action is very exciting while it lasts.  You get to see kendo sticks, chairs, tables, and good old-fashioned lumberjack gang-ups.  The problem is that this match is very short.  I think it only lasted about 6 minutes from bell to bell.  That is beyond stupid.  Maybe it was to push Cena.  Maybe it was to embarass ECW.  Maybe it was to prevent Sabu from having any botches.  Bottom line - a very good match was cut short for no good reason."6.5 / 10"_______________________________________________8) 2-on-5 Handicap MatchD-Generation X (Shawn Michaels & Triple H) v.The Spirit Squad (World Tag Team champions)---I don't have a big problem with this being the main event, because it makes a lot of sense.  DX was making RAW a very fun TV program, and boosting ratings and merchandise sales.  And let's be honest, most of the fans in attendance wanted to see DX more than anything else, even John Cena or Ric Flair.  The main event doesn't even have to be the best match on the card for me; but it MUST be a good match.  This Handicap Match is solid, but not "good".  What results from this 5-on-2 scenario is HBK & HHH doing a lot comedy spots to embarass the cheerleaders, who didn't need more embarassing anyway.  There are a lot of unique spots, like The Spirit Squad using a trampoline to deliver aerial attacks, or whenever DX throws their opponents around like rag dolls into each other.  And besides, what's the point?  DX made it pretty clear that they weren't going anywhere in the weeks building up to this PPV; if Spirit Squad won, then maybe this would've been significant.  As it stands, this main event feels like a longer RAW match, and not a PPV presentation.  I was a little let down when I paid 40 PPV dollars for this, but even when I managed to get this DVD for just 3 bucks...I was still underwhelmed.  Oh, and this match is on the NEW & IMPROVED DX DVD anyway."6.5 / 10"_______________________________________________VENGEANCE 2006 has a lot of bonus content compared to normal WWE PPV releases these days.  It also has two excellent matches, and few decent ones.  The problem is all of this good content is available on other WWE DVDs.  The DX stuff has been re-released on another DX set, with the main event and other matches included.  And the exciting triple threat match for the IC Title was included on the solid 3-disc set for this belt.  The only match on the DVD I recommend going out of your way to see is the WWE Championship Match, especially because no other match from 2006 was as much as fun as this one for me.VENGEANCE 2006 wasn't a great a PPV to begin with.  As long as you don't have the other bonus content on other sets, then this 3-star deal may be a 4-star package for you. </p>

 <p> Vengeance 2006 was a solid night of fun. DX returned and won, RVD retained his title, Kane fought himself for the first time ever, and ECW was in full swing as John Cena won the lumberjack match.Randy Orton vs. Kurt Angle:A solid match to start the show. Both men had a lot more time to work with compared to ECW ONS 2  a few weeks ago, which was great. Some highlights include Angle giving Randy a German Suplex on the floor! Then Randy fights back with some underhanded tactics such as a thumb to the eye and throwing Angle back first into the barricade. They fight back in the ring and Randy eventually takes a pad off the top turnbuckle while Angle tries to put Randy in the ankle lock. Randy sends Angle into the exposed turnbuckle head first and then connects with the RKO for the win! 8/10 [The only problem that I could see was that the crowd was surprisingly dead for most part of this match, oh well....]Umaga vs. Eugene:Before the match Eugene brought out Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Doink the Clown, and Kamala for backup. They didn't help at all as Umaga destroyed Eugene in about 30 seconds for the win. After the match Umaga takes out Duggan, Doink, but holds back against Kamala for some reason. 1/10 [This was what people in the stadium would call a "bathroom break."]2 Out Of 3 Falls MatchRic Flair vs. Mick Foley:I was very interested in seeing this match, just to see if Foley would indeed wrestle without using any weapons. The beginning of the match had Flair out wrestling Foley, but Foley fought back and even pulled out Mr. Socko who was dressed up as Flair himself, complete with a robe and everything. Flair wins the first fall after reversing the Figure Four into an inside cradle and pinning Foley.After the first fall the two men fight into the crowd and Foley even back drops Flair back into the inside part of the barricade right on the floor! They fight back in the ring and Foley brings out a trashcan and throws it into the ring. Flair eventually puts Foley into the Figure Four but Foley nailed him in the head with the trash can and got disqualified. Flair won the match. 8.5/10 [A pretty good match actually.][After the match Foley destroyed Flair with the trash can and a barbed wire baseball bat! Flair was an ugly bloody mess as referees separated the two men.]Intercontinental ChampionshipCarlito vs. Shelton Benjamin [Champion] vs. Johnny Nitro:Can I just say Melina is too damn hot for Nitro?... Anyone agree? This was a match that I really could not predict who would win, no matter how hard I tried. This was a fast paced, very entertaining match. All three men kept getting near falls and reversals to each other's moves. Highlights include an INSANE looking triple suplex type move by all three men in the corner that has to be seen to be believed. So many near falls I couldn't keep track. The end comes when Carlito hits Benjamin with his back breaking type move but then Nitro pulls Carlito out of the way and gets the three count. 9/10 [Great, fast paced match]WWE ChampionshipRob Van Dam [Champion] vs. Edge:Glad Cena did not get a rematch at this ppv. This match was very back and forth in the beginning. Highlights include RVD hitting a moonsault off the barricade on the outside onto Edge. Then Edge fights back with a sunset flip powerbomb off the apron to RVD to the floor! They continued to fight and RVD missed Edge with a spin kick and nailed the ref. Edge went for the championship belt but RVD gave the Van Daminator to Edge with the belt! The end comes when Edge tries to spear RVD but misses and hits a chair that Lita was holding up, and RVD nails the Five Star Frog Splash for the win! 9/10 [Great match and some wicked looking moves that I didn't include take place in this match as well.]Kane vs. Kane:I thought the intro of the "fake" Kane last month was pretty good, but rumor has it Mr. McMahon does not like the way the storyline is going. This was pretty much big man moves all the way. Both giants used clotheslines and boots to the faces all throughout the match. Kane even tried to rip the mask off the imposter's face but the fake Kane fought back. Near the end Kane went to the top rope but got caught in a chokeslam and was pinned. 6/10Extreme Lumberjack MatchSabu vs. John Cena:ECW Wrestlers and RAW Superstars circled the ring as the two men fought. ECW Wrestlers included; The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Justin Credible, Balls Mahoney, Roadkill, Danny Doring, Little Guido, and Steven Richards. WWE RAW Superstars included; Matt Striker, Snitsky, Val Venis, Trevor Murdoch, Lance Cade, Charlie Hass, and Viscera.The match was full of moments when either Sabu or Cena were sent out and RAW and ECW Wrestlers beat up the other man. The Sandman even caned Cena in the head with his singapore cane. Sabu used a steel chair all throughout the match and nailed his signature moves such as the triple jump moonsault and the Arabian Facebuster on Cena with the steel chair. It didn't take long however, when the ECW and RAW wrestlers started going at it. Sabu almost puts Cena through a table on the outside but Viscera comes out of nowhere and nails Sabu with a singapore cane.Back in the ring Cena throws Sabu over the tope rope and Sabu took a sick looking spot as he hit the edge of the table. Sabu gets thrown in the ring during all the fighting and Cena locks on the STFU for the win. 8/10 [To be honest, I was expecting A LOT more violence, but still a pretty good match, however I was rooting for Sabu.]Handicap MatchDegeneration X vs. The Spirit Squad:Nice to see DX back after so many years. The crowd was WAY over with DX and booed the hell out of the Spirit Squad. The match was full of crotch chops and pants being pulled down by DX on the Spirit Squad. Michaels tried to pull Mikey out of the ring but gets hit with a chair on the outside. Triple H soon gets beaten up by the big group as the crowd continued to boo the Spirit Squad. In the end however Shawn Michaels hit Sweet Chin Music and Triple H hit the pedigree for the double win. 9/10I recommend this DVD highly. A lot of great matches took place. The only real duds were Umaga/Eugene, and Kane/Kane matches. Besides that this is one solid wrestling ppv.Highly recommended. </p>
