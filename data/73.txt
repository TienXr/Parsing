 <p> The Macbook cover protects my computer well.  It also looks better than the traditional black covers that you so often see. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Stylish and Secure </p>

 <p> Arrived on time, nice. As described, a soft cushiony zipped case for my 13.3" MacBook Air. Since the Air is slimmer than the standard MacBook Pro, there's room inside for additional items, as in my case, the power cord. You could easily slip in your cell phone or even your iPad if you have both like I do. Does have a slight plastic foam smell to it, but I had to hold it up to my nose to sniff it. Typical for a plastic product thats been packaged. It will dissipate. Zipper works fine, it opens from the short side top for easy access.  A good value for the money spent. Exactly what I was looking. </p>

 <p> I purchased this for my new MacBook Pro 13".  The case fits fine, although a single zipper on the long side to one of the short sides ( "L" shape ) is more convenient instead of a double zipper on a short side.This product product is potentially a health hazard as the aromatic compounds are readily apparent as I discovered.  Perhaps it needs to air out after manufacturing before packaging or make use of environmentally-safe and human-safe materials.If you must buy this product, consider opening the package outside, letting it air out for approximately 3-4 days before use.Resources:[...] </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I bought this for $9.  I can confirm what the other reviewers said - it smells weird, and has weird white X's in certain places on the case.  To me, not a big deal because I just wanted a cheap carrying case for my MacBook Air.  It fits absolutely fine, so that's my main criteria.  But this is definitely one of those "you get what you pay for" bags.  Don't expect something you'll fall in love with.  But it does the job just fine. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Cheap, does the job, has some issues </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This sleeve bag is quite stylish to me. fits macbook pro 13 perfectly. But there is not much protection. It certainly protects from scratch if you put it in your school bag, but it just doesn't help if you drop it. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> not much protection </p>
