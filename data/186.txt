 <p> Keoma is a unique and wonderful film. It has what you would want from any spaghetti western, and perhaps a bit more. Franco Nero is excellent as the title character. His Italian accent just fits perfectly for some reason. The story starts out simply enough, and soon becomes an epic tale of revenge, with great action and excellent slow motion scenes permeating the gunfights. My only complaint is the soundtrack, which can sometimes get out of hand and ridiculous, but it doesn't take up the whole movie, thankfully.If you really enjoy movies like Django, For a Fistful of Dollars, or The Great Silence, then you shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up. You'll be pleasantly surprised. </p>

 <p> It's no exaggeration to say this film ranks right up there (awfully close anyway) with Leone...There was alot care taken with atmosphere and symbolism...This movie isn't a mindless excuse for loads of violence (A la &quot;Navajo Joe&quot;) that some spaghetti westerns (love 'em as much as I do) end up being sometimes.Franco Nero is great as a half Indian Christ-like figure named Keoma and Woody Strode gives a wonderfully sympathetic performance as an ex-slave who is his friend and role model since childhood and has now fallen on hard times.Nero is right up there with Eastwood and Van Cleef...a premier Spaghetti western actor who is the epitome of cool.Dont miss this one! </p>

 <p> Disclaimer: The version of 'Keoma' that I watched is included in theGunslinger Western Collection- as such I cannot comment on the quality of the DVD offered on this product page. Instead, this review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.Well-liked by fans and well-respected by critics, this late entry from the heyday of Italian westerns stars genre icon Franco Nero as a half-Indian, half-white soldier returning from the Civil War to find his hometown in the grips of a plague and controlled by a ruthless gang of ex-confederates.  To make matters worse, his three half brothers have thrown in with the gang's leader, Caldwell, and Keoma's return only reawakes the hatred they feel for him.  Perhaps for himself as much as the townspeople, Keoma defies the gang and his brothers, rescuing a pregnant women and guarding her as she prepares to have her baby, as well as destroying the power of the gang.Director Enzo Castellari explores several different themes with this film - I might be tempted to say TOO many - though I think most obviously, 'Keoma' is a comment on the struggle against fate.  Packed with symbolism and conventions from tragedy, and mixed with super-stylized violence and western stereotypes, Castellari risks pretentious silliness against making an epic, insightful character study.  Popular opinion indicates a positive reception - although after watching the first time, I disagreed.  After another viewing, I'm not so sure.Beyond a doubt, there are isolated elements to this film that, examined separately from the total experience, seem ridiculous and unflattering.  Most reviewers mention at least something about the soundtrack, which, like a Greek chorus, has its singers who narrate onscreen events as they are happening --but even worse is the style in which they are sung.  This rather bizarre experiment has to be heard to appreciated -- and even though it actually grew on me while watching it again, it's tremendously awkward the first time around.  Another odd aspect, especially from the jaded position of contemporary times, is how serious this film takes itself.  Symbolic messages such as the redeemer who is crucified by the crowd in exchange for worldly gain, or the birth of a baby to suggest the re-birth of a society, or even of the outsider with his physical differences to cement his 'apartness' from the norm -- depending on how they are presented -- can seem played out or at least less effective through over-use.  And whether or not Castellari 'borrowed' the idea of super-slow motions death scenes from the Peckinpah school of filmmaking, it still seems excessive.  As a statement or as a stylistic choice, it strikes me as an element that exists within the film only for its own sake.  Along with the way that Nero dresses in the film, they seem like reflections of what the filmmakers thought would be really super-duper to have in their movie.Those were my objections at first, and I still hold to them, even after watching again -- yet there is also an odd sense that these different elements work together better than I first thought.  Picking them apart as I have done doesn't take into account the gestalt effect: It isn't so much a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts, it's that any isolated 'part' could actually be considered a subtraction from the whole, and the audacity of including so many of them together in one film propels the storyline into 'Epic' territory, where modern filmmakers seem afraid to go for fear of being laughed at.  'Keoma' is an attempt at a serious statement - albeit using techniques that we've grown used to seeing parodied, or used like self-deprecating in-jokes by the director too tentative to stand by his design.Ultimately, this viewer is still trying to decide whether 'Keoma' is as pretentious and silly as he first thought, or whether it is an interesting statement gained through unusual means.  With it's many variations, the Italian western genre eventually defies reductionism, but one aspect I've always enjoyed was a distinct refusal to peer inward at its characters, relying instead on the implications of their outward actions.  We may get a glimpse of their motivations by observing individuals, but rarely do the scripts call for exploring any psychological underpinnings.  Yet that is exactly what 'Keoma' is about - in fact, one might say that is _entirely_ what it is about.The rest of the cast turn in fine performances -- I like William Berger and Donald O'Brien better here than in other films of theirs that I've seen -- and Nero and Woody Strode are on par with their usual work.  Production value is better than most early Eurowesterns, and while some of the minor characters are dubbed in, the principals -- even Nero -- speak English.  But in the end, I can only give this film a moderate recommendation, as I have a feeling that it's appeal will be highly individualistic.  I will say that if the film disappoints initially, it may be worth your time to watch it again at a later time, as I found that once I was prepared for some of the quirkier elements, I could better appreciate the story's depth.The version I watched which is included in the Gunslinger collection was put out by Pop Flix.  There are no extras, but the transfer was clean in an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It might well be worth the cost of this collection, either inthisformat or inthisone, just to first determine your interest level in the film.  I'm happy enough with the version I have that I feel no need to upgrade, but if I did, I wouldn't hesitate to go with this copy put out by Blue Underground, as I have some of their other DVDs, and have no complaints. </p>

 <p> I will attempt to avoid any spoilers.A lot of the lesser known spaghetti westerns have fair to poor quality for their dvd transfers, this one has very good quality.The film itself is surprisingly good. Nero's thick accent is a strength here, portraying an outcast half-breed.  The improvisational aspect of the script (the director supposedly did not like the script and they apparently would sit around the evening after filming and write the next day's lines) shows a bit, creating a couple slightly 'off' scenes here and there which do not really affect the film overall, but I will say the final line is horrible, in my opinion.The weakest aspect of the film is the soundtrack.  This movie could be over the top good with a Morricone soundtrack.  The ballads are supposed to be narrative, but they are......highly irritating.  There are those people that like the soundtrack, more power to those who don't wince when the songs start.  Fortunately when they do start singing, it's almost always a long, dialogue free section that can easily be fast-forwarded through.The cast is strong, and the cinematography excellent.  There are some very unique visuals, solid editing, and some nice sound-work.  A gem of a movie to find for under $10. </p>

 <p> This is really a great western and is along with Damiani's A Bullet for the General, one of the best italian westerns along with those made by the three great Sergios (Corbucci, Leone and Sollima). What's even more fascinating is how Castellari managed to make a film with no script, making up the dialogs as the shooting went along (even if he copied a bevy of filmakers along the way; try to figure them out as you watch the film), all this adding to it's really bleak and bizarre look. I actually enjoyed the music which was a reference to Altman's great western McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller. And Franco Nero never looked better and cooler than in this film!Though the film was made at a time when italian westerns were practically dead, as they had already been made into a parody with the Trinity films, Keoma didn't manage to resurrect the genre. Why? Maybe because nobody could figure a way to top this film, which gives you a general idea of how good it is.The DVD copy is absolutely brilliant, as is anything coming from Anchor Bay, and it features a great commentary by Castellari himself (though I find annoying the journalists Anchor Bay send to view the films along with the directors, as any real fan would have a trillion more questions to ask).Overall, a great film that should be (re)discovered by any western fan! </p>

 <p> Fittingly released as "Django Rides Again", "Keoma" reads like a final farewell not just to the man that helped popularize the genre, Franco Nero (who was supposedly a bigger draw in Europe than Clint Eastwood), but to the spaghetti Western as well. Keoma is replete with themes that came to identify the spaghetti Western. Is it a ghost story, as seen by the woman that haunts Keoma? Is it a tale of redemption, George's last attempt at righting that which he squandered? Is it a simple revenge tale, Keoma going after the brothers that tortured him as a child? Or is it a tale of one man protecting innocent townspeople from an external threat, as seen by the presence of the villainous Caldwell? In essence, "Keoma" is about all this and more. That so many elements were meshed together successfully, without giving precedence to one yet letting the plot fold naturally, is to the credit of screenwriter Enzo G. Castellari. Coupled with the direction - also by Castellari - with camera movements that flow with the action, peering through tight spaces and over shoulders yet never intrusively, the film blossoms with a lyrical quality. There is a sadness to this film. Not just in plot, but perhaps with the realization of all parties involved that the days of the spaghetti Western are over. As for the soundtrack, which keeps Keoma from being a flawless film, well . . . the less said, the better </p>

 <p> I have a lot of "Spaghetti Westerns" in my collection, and this one is far from the worst, but it's not one of the best either. Franco Nero is always enjoyable, as is Woody Strode, but still I found myself yawning and struggling to pay attention after forty five minutes or so. But whenever my mind would drift, I would have it jerked violently back to the screen by the caterwaulling female and ghoulish male vocals that are present throughout the movie, not only providing "musical" accompaniment, but also providing some of the most bizarre narration ever recorded. Seriously, you've got to hear this soundtrack; it terrified not only my dogs, but probably my neighbors dogs as well! I cannot describe it justly, as I have nothing to campare it to; you must hear it for yourself. You'll laugh and cringe in equal measure.So, back to the film itself. Present are violence, cruelty, a lone vengeful wanderer; ya know, a Spaghetti Western (SW). If you've seen many of these, you'll recognize the themes right away. There are some elements though that are not so typical in Italian Westerns.An element present in Keoma that you may notice right away is the use of a technique pioneered by the great Sam Peckinpah; slow motion, graceful, violence. Characters who are shot twist and fall dramatically, often into puddles, over railings, or through walls. Flashbacks are treated uniquley too. Keoma's present-day self is physically present in his flashbacks seemingly an invisible observer to characters in the scene. It's an interesting effect and actually works quite well. Another element present not used in many Italian Westerns is the Mega-Mullet, which the always enjoyable Franco Nero sports to the fullest. It is unbelievable. You will want to touch it. Did I mention the soundtrack? So yeah, it's really not so typical for an SW; you definitely wont mistake it for Ennio Morricone. There is a witch too, but she's not really fleshed out much.The widescreen print is fairly clean and bright throughout, though the colors arent necessarily vivid (but maybe they werent to begin with). There is an interview with Franco Nero and a theatrical trailer on the disc as well. Overall, the is another nice package from Anchor Bay.One last side-note on the package: boy-oh-boy are the covers on these Anchor Bay Spagheti Westerns ever unattractive! They look like the dull, muddy, Photoshop work of a highschooler; an afterthought rather than the first impression that they are. It probably wont bother most viewers though. I just wish that Anchor Bay would've taken a que from Wild East and used elements from the original theatrical posters if they cant create attractive new graphics for the package. </p>

 <p> Spaghetti westerns are, in my opinion, generally the best fictional films about the American West. You can argue that John Wayne made a bunch of great movies about life in the Old West, and you would be right to say so, but for some reason the Italians captured perfectly the specific elements of the era that made their movies seem more realistic. The frontier was a dirty, violent place full of unsavory types trying to get rich quick. Italian westerns capture this mood expertly whereas American films portray characters whose outfits look like they just came back from the dry cleaners. Hollywood films also tend to apply a black and white dichotomy onto their characters, the old "good guys wear white, bad guys wear black" philosophy that obscures the reality of the time and place. Not so in Italian films, where even the good guys often have distinctly unsavory traits. It's too bad spaghetti westerns went the way of the dinosaurs a few decades back; I never tire of watching these films even though I am not an expert on the genre. "Keoma," part of the larger Anchor Bay "Once Upon a Time in Italy" spaghetti western box set, serves as an excellent example of how powerful the genre once was.Surprisingly, I discovered none other than director Enzo G. Castellari lensed this epic western, and actually made it when the spaghetti western genre was essentially dead on its feet. Castellari's name should ring a few bells with fans of low budget Italian schlock; he's the guy who made "1990: The Bronx Warriors" and "Escape From the Bronx," two science fiction films of such mediocre standards that anyone who appreciates such things should immediately check them out. With "Keoma," Castellari proves he's much better than most of his output. The story stars the ever reliable Franco Nero as Keoma, a brooding, mixed blood loner returning home from the Civil War to find his family and his town suffering under the throes of a plague and a gang of thugs. The cast of characters in this picture is a veritable who's who of low budget Italian movies. You've got Olga Karlatos, sans a splinter to the eye, playing a woman infected with the plague. Donald O'Brien turns up in the role of gang leader Caldwell. Then there's Woody Strode as George, a one time slave owned by Keoma's father who now ambles about town drinking himself into a stupor and plucking a broken down banjo. William Berger turns in a competent performance as William Shannon, Keoma's father as well as the father of the loner's three half brothers. How can you go wrong with such a cast?Keoma has several problems. First, he can't stand to sit idly by as thugs prey on the townspeople. His concern in this area leads him to rescue Karlatos's character from the clutches of several gang members, something he must do occasionally throughout the film as none of the citizens in town want this infected woman living in their midst. Second, his three brothers--Lenny (Antonio Marsina), Cham (Joshua Sinclair), and Butch (Orso Maria Guerrini)--carry a huge grudge against their half brother. They always have, too, as we learn from flashbacks to Keoma's childhood appearing throughout the film. Third, Keoma must continually confront members of Caldwell's gang, no easy feat considering the sheer numbers of ex-Confederate soldiers now working for this brutal goon. You just know from the start that these three elements will eventually culminate in a frenetic, no holds barred shoot out with a high body count. Thankfully, Keoma possesses the necessary skills--a quick draw, piercing gaze, and flashing fists--to get the job done."Keoma" is a spaghetti western unlike "A Bullet for the General" or "Companeros," two of the other films in the box set, because Castellari refused to instill a strident political message in the story. In fact, if the biography of the director included in the extras section on the disc is any indication, Nero and Castellari made up the dialogue and scenes as they went along since the two men disliked the initial script. "Keoma" is more along the lines of a Leone/Eastwood epic in that the hero rides into town, purges the necessary evils, and then moves on at the end. It's a lesson in good versus evil, folks, and it's a very good exposition on that age-old cinematic dichotomy. Two other elements help "Keoma" shine in my eyes. First, the music score is unique to say the least. Imagine twangy, Leonard Cohenesque narrative songs praising the virtues and activities of the main hero as the action unfolds, and you'll have some idea of what the film sounds like. Or maybe not. You really need to hear the songs yourself in order to fathom the experience. Second, and most important, Castellari relies heavily on stylish, slow motion violence typical of Sam Peckinpah countless times throughout the movie. We see guys flying through the air full of buckshot, falling off of horses after catching a bullet, and splashing into water frequently. It's great fun.Anchor Bay deserves our kudos for once again doing a great job on a spaghetti western. The widescreen transfer looks good (although not as good as "Companeros" or "A Bullet for the General"). Extras on the disc include a lengthy trailer, bios for Franco Nero and Castellari, and a ten-minute interview with Nero about the production of the film. Even more surprising is the inclusion of a commentary track with Enzo Castellari himself. The director promises to make another western in the future toward the end of the commentary track, but time will tell. I'd sure like to see a resurgence of the spaghetti western genre. Until then, I'll content myself with films such as "Keoma." </p>

 <p> The legendary Spaghetti Western actor Franco Nero stars as a half-breed Indian outcast, who grew up being tormented by his three spiteful half-brothers. The forsaken vagabond returns home after an unnamed period of time only to be greeted by his kin with gun in hand. Luckily for Keoma, his father and now fallen idol George have remained loyal to him.Everything from the shot selection to the acting, characters, story and overall pacing in this movie is great, all except the music. Now I understand Ennio Morricone could not possibly have scored every single Western shot in Italy during the 60's and 70's (and I don't think he should have) but the soundtrack on Keoma is pretty awful. I could tell that they were going for a folk style soundtrack, but instead they ended up with a few songs that sounded more like wounded coyote's with acoustic guitars playing in the background.Enzo G Castellari, who would later go on to make the original Inglorious Bastards (1978), took a few pages out of the SP Western Godfather's playbook. Using lots of close-ups and dramatic pauses as well as other subtle effects (the water hose constantly running in the middle of town) Leone's influence is strongly felt. The quick draw slo-mo scenes were very effectively used, making us feel like these cowboys were like greased lightning. Keoma's weapon of choice, a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun, is definitely something that sets him apart from other Western anti-heroes. This weapon was almost certainly homaged when used in the self-dubbed "Mexican Western", Desperado, directed by Robert Rodriguez. If you like noodle Westerns or just Westerns in general, I highly recommend giving Keoma a viewing. </p>

 <p> Keoma is the story of a boy who was born from a white man and an indian woman and is loved more by his father than his two white brothers.  Franco Nero is fantastic as Keoma and proves that the Italian spaghetti western was alive and well and very strong at that time.  Years go by and Keoma grows up as a man and is pitted against his two brothers when a bad guy wants to take control of the town that Keoma grew up in when he was a child.  Up against him is his two step brothers who have joind sides with the leader and his gang.  Franco Nero gives a stellar performane and is the real deal is this movie.  I loved this movie right from the git-go.  If you like good westerns, good action and adventure, you will love this picture.  One of the better spaghetti-westerns after Clint's. </p>

 <p> KEOMA is arguably Castellari's best movie, up there alongside HIGH CRIME, THE BIG RACKET, THE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS, and STREET LAW.  Rarely has Castellari excelled so well at creating pure poeticism through editing and camera techniques.  The story often feels disjointed or confusing, but overall the experience is very rewarding with plenty of action, an engaging storyline, well-rounded characters, an excellent cast, and a good (if overused) soundtrack by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis.  Where the movie really takes off are its use of slow motion and bizarre seemless scene transitions.The DVD is absolutely loaded as it comes with a dazzling commentary by Enzo G. Castellari.  Unlike Umberto Lenzi or Dario Argento, Castellari does not have a thick Italian accent so it's relatively easy to understand everything he says.  He does trail off at a few points when he really should be giving background on the actors and techniques, but the commentary does not fail in being one of the most INTERESTING I have heard in a long time.  It's too bad the journalist who mediated the commentary didn't seem to have a very wide knowledge of the genre, though he was able to recognize Donal O'Brien from ZOMBI HOLOCAUST.The picture quality is beyond crisp, this is the best the movie has ever looked (yeah I know it's a cliche to say this about Anchor Bay DVDs, but this one deserves it).  The film is also the UNCUT version which has never been available in the states, and also is presented in its proper widescreen aspect ratio for the first time anywhere ever.  Those like me who bought the old import tape from Holland will be blown away because the look of the film is so different than before.The only flaw is the sound, which sounds a tad hissy when the actors are talking.  This is partially due to the fact I have a quiet DVD player and have to turn the sound up to full blast just to hear it regularly, so it amplifies the flaws.  On a regular player the sound should be just fine.All in all, there is no excuse to miss this movie.  It's not so much a Spaghetti Western as it is an action movie with lyrical and poetic subtexts with an almost hyper-real stylized Western setting.  Vastly superior to Italy's many Django films though not quite in Sergio Leone territory.  This film is so different from Leone's work that it can't really be compared. </p>

 <p> I try to collect all of the stuff that specific actor's/director's play/direct, but there are some exclusions. There are also many DVDs from directors/actors that I respect, but don't collect everything. Finally there are some specific movies which do not relate to any of my favourites. Such is Keoma. I don't collect western movies (except for those three movies with Leone-Eastwood connection), I don't collect Franco Nero's movies, I didn't follow Enzo Castellano's movies as well, but this movie is outstanding, a different one.Everything is simple: the story line (they started filming without script in their hands!), the actors, camera work, but the overall result gives something different than a simple bang-bang movie. One has to watch it first to understand. This is a metaphorical expression of life and death which requires some brain work from a watcher. And from listener too! The music/songs are indivisible from the movie (as it was planned to be). The vocal is nervous, yes, but such is the film, and our life, in fact. It does not leave a listener indifferent, it captures, it tells the story, it leads from the beginning to the end.The only disadvantage is that the movie is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono, but I forgot about it at all by the middle of the movie. Since ther is (was?) no other choice, I decided not to lower my rating down to 4 stars.The picture quality is, I believe, the best possible for the moment, because Blue Underground would make it better if they had a chance. I hope it is so. </p>

 <p> I recently picked up Keoma as part of Anchor Bay's cool &quot;Once Upon a Time In Italy&quot; collection. This handy box-set also included &quot;Texas Adios&quot;, &quot;A Bullet For The General&quot;, &quot;Companeros&quot;, and &quot;Four Of The Apocalypse&quot;. After reading some pretty glowing reviews for Keoma, I had high hopes and expected it to be the best if not one of the better films included. Boy was I wrong!While the film itself was fairly interesting and included some nice touches (especially an unexpected appearance by character actor &quot;Woody Strode&quot; - and some cleverly shot flashback sequences), it had an &quot;overdone&quot; quality to it. They were trying too hard for a &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Mainly, this movie was plagued with the worst score I've ever had the misfortune to hear! The music itself wasn't the problem. What was however, were the annoying-as-hell female and male vocalists used to narrate the action throughout the movie. God they were AWFUL!!! They wouldn't shut up!In the future, I plan to re-watch Keoma with the sound muted. That's the only way I feel I could sit through it again! Who knows? Maybe I'll enjoy it! I really wanted to like this movie.I wouldn't normally recommend a movie that I gave a 2 of 5 star rating for, but If you can rent this one, you need to hear the score just for laughs. </p>

 <p> The mystical, eerie and rather sombre opening of this late (1976) entry into the Italian western cycle, with its at first somewhat confusing flashback structure and alternation of bright, colorful daylight and gloomy, dusty apocalyptic destruction, all dominated by the fierce old witch-woman who will keep reappearing in the film, might lead you to think you are in for a deep, metaphysical and narratively challenging experiment.But hold on, pardner! "Keoma" soon settles down into a fairly typical narrative: Civil War vet comes back to his hometown to find it taken over by bad guys; vet has to save the town all by his lonesome.  And Keoma bears more than a little resemblance in attitude and wild appearance to plenty of cowboy antiheroes in the past (i.e., The Man With No Name). That's not to say it's boring or formulaic, because over that basic storyline there's plenty to marvel at: gorgeous photography, particularly in the bright daylight scenes, a terrific folk-rock score highlighted by a Leonard Cohen-type male vocalist, a typically solid performance by Franco Nero, and some interesting story touches like a plague that ravages the town (plague? yes) -- a town that seems ready to fall apart, more dreary and decayed even than the one Django rides through in the film of the same name.  It's probably no coincidence that a couple of the titles the film has been known by had "Django" in them; then again, so did about a third of all the Italian westerns made after the original DJANGO.Keoma not only has to confront the evil gunslinger who has taken over the town, but his henchmen turn out to be Keoma's three half-brothers, and oh -- Keoma is a halfbreed Indian (yes, despite being blonde, blue-eyed and hairy-chested) and his best friend is a black man (the great Woody Strode, looking pretty good at the age of 62). The film doesn't really dig much into the racial aspects of the story, though it doesn't ignore them either. But it all really boils down to a couple of really terrific gunfights at the end, lots of slow-mo Sam Peckinpah-type action (but without much blood), a Christ-on-the-cross image, and a hero riding off into...bleakness? Death?  Given the apocalyptic visions throughout the film, I was reminded more than once of Jodorowsky's EL TOPO, which makes such visions come true.Director Enzo G. Castellari made a few other westerns in the earlier part of his career, which dates back a decade before this one; none are remotely as well known as KEOMA but I'd still like to see some of them.  And as one of the few Italian genre directors from the golden age of the 60s and 70s to still be making films, let's hope he's got another western in him, somewhere.  Whether he does or not, this seems in any case like perfect coda to the spaghetti. </p>

 <p> I thought Keoma was just a wonderful spaghetti western film . Franco Nero as always manages to give another great performance. Enzo G.Castellari gives wonderful direction to this western classic. 8/10I would recommend anything from Corbucci to Leone. I'd also recommend Castellari's Street Law , The Big Racket , and The Heroin Busters.[...]. </p>

 <p> This movie is cool. It's got what Spaghetti westerns are made of, but the horrible music track of that woman screaming throughout the movie took me off track every time. It sounded like a howling banshee. The quality of the widescreen DVD has been cleaned great, and all else is good. </p>

 <p> I love this movie. The atmosphere is great. The action scenes are fantastic. I even love the music! Especially when Keoma's father meets his end. Olga Karlatos is great as always. I highly recommend this film to everyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns or just good films. If you don't own it, get it!!! </p>

 <p> Review of Anchor Bay DVD production of KeomaTHE BADPost-sound production sound work. The voices are over-modulated, hissy, gritty and raspy. The voices overpower the ambience sounds. Every other word breaks up as if the actors were to close to a cheap microphone. The effect is that the voices to seem to be disembodied from the actors. The good mood music and songs are so compressed and muddy that all ambience, and dynamics of the music are lost. The background ambience sounds such as horses hoofs or wind or gunshots are compressed, muffled or to low. The film stock although clear, crisp and colorful has a cheap look.The accents are at times over the top except the Protagonist. He is supposed to be a half-breed Native American - but has an Italian accent. In one scene a man twists and falls seemingly before the gun is fired. There are a couple of obvious novice actors. There are some embarrassing pretentious macho cliches and campy dialogue... That said...Read on...THE GOOD.Keoma is full of style, artistry, imagination, atmosphere, pathos and symbolism. There are authentic looking frontier ghost towns and western paraphernalia, dust storms, rain storms, dark hazy nights, crazed mobs, smoky bars, gritty costumes and a some good, albeit mostly unknown, character actors.The camera work is magical. The movie is shot through and or framed with in wagon wheels, fire, running water, fingers, tattered rags, fence-posts, stair railings, halfcocked doors, splits and cracks in lumber and bullet holes.The editing works well splicing in slow motion scenes far better then others - outside of Peckinpah.The actors fit their rolls well. The four brothers have an incredible look-alike as the adult versions of the four children.Keoma might be considered an art film, borrowing from the New Testament (the prodigal son, the healing of the lepers, crucifixion, death, rebirth, (in one scene Keoma actually walks on water!), Hamlet (An apathetic and disillusioned Kemoa is visited by the ghost of his father), Macbeth (a reoccurring old Witch tells the future). There are allusions to Bergmann's The Seventh Seal, Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Shakespear's King Lear, and Camus's The Plague.The film is full of well-written vignettes as homage to numerous other westerns. There is also an obvious similarity between the end of Keoma and the end of Ron Howard's the Paper (1994). Nevertheless, Keoma was made 18 years before the Paper.The story moves ahead keeping you interested the whole time. Flashbacks are built into the story without special effects. The flashbacks are appropriately dreamlike.In spite of what some say, the strange music fits the macabre off kilter atmosphere of the story. The fault in the music is more in its post recording and sound production. Not the music itself.The film ends up being violent, funny, strangely beautiful, fantastic, dreamlike, daring and completely original.If you are able to overlook the postproduction video and sound shortcomings, along with a little campy dialogue, a couple of novis actors and some pretentiousness Keoma is haunting, entertaining, and very rewatchable. It should be among the list of best westerns, spaghetti westerns, and art films.In my opinion this Anchor Bay version of Keoma (especially if you love film making) is very worth owning.ONE WISHThe Kemoa Song, played during the Anchor Bays main menu has the depth, ambience and dynamics that are missing throughout the sound on the rest of the film. Its obvious that since Anchor Bay could do this with this short piece of music - the same could be accomplished during the rest of the film. I wish one day this film's sound and picture quality gets the love and care it so deserves. </p>

 <p> Being a veteran of very few spaghetti westerns (I was on National Guard Duty at the time, so to speak), I wasn't sure what to expect from this one.  I've seen KEOMA listed on a couple of top-100 westerns and decided to give it a go.It's opening, atmospheric and a little over-the-top, fulfilled my expectations. A bearded, unidentified man (Keoma - Franco Nero) slowly rides into a desolate landscape.  It looks like a town that has cantered over onto its side.  The winds blow and small fires burn here and there.  An old crone (The Witch - Gabriella Giacobbe) confronts Keoma, it turns out, is no stranger here.  "I changed destiny," the Witch says, "when I decided that you alone would survive that useless massacre.""Aren't you tired of killing?" The Witch asks the first of many questions thrown at Keoma throughout the movie.  Keoma, thick bearded with hair down to the bare chest under his white duster, doesn't answer.  His eyes flash, he gallops off a short way, turns and yells back to her: "You have to survive."Keoma is back home from "the war" (the American Civil War, I think) and home has changed drastically.  A plague has hit town and those who aren't dead are carted off to a internment center by the evil mine-owner Caldwell (who doesn't allow anyone to leave town to get food or medicine.)  Keoma intercepts a cart loaded with plague-infected victims and rescues a pregnant woman, (the drop-dead gorgeous Olga Karlatos).Keoma has to protect this woman and her unborn child, and defeat the evil Caldwell.  It's a heavy task, but Keoma can throw a knife through the palm of a man drawing his gun from a half-mile off and shoot three men dead before any one of them has the chance to draw their gun from their holster.  If he goes down, he'll bring a lot down with him.Keoma will also have to deal with his three evil step-brothers; the massacre the Witch spoke of must have happened in an Indian village.  Keoma is a half-breed, adopted and best beloved by his father and George (Woody Strode), and his half-brothers hate him for it.KEOMA revels in its excesses and isn't to everybody's tastes.  Dust is ALWAYS blowing through the broken down town unless a raging night thunderstorm rolls through.  Keoma plays a savior of sorts and to show their appreciation the townfolk tie him down on a large wheel that is an obvious and heavy-handed reference to a crucifixion.  When a bad guy is shot, he tumbles backward in a slow-motion shot that would make Sam Peckinpah blush. You'll either love or hate the soundtrack (I hated it.  Hated it, hated it, hated it.)This one wouldn't make my top 100 list, but it wouldn't make a worst-of list, either. </p>

 <p> Made in 1976, Keoma was released at the tail end of the spaghetti western craze, but it's one of the best either way.  Following the Civil War, half-breed gunman Keoma returns home to find the town taken over by an ex-Confederate soldier, Caldwell, and his gang and the townspeople suffering from a form of the plague. Caldwell isn't letting in help or medicine of any kind.  Keoma saves a young pregnant woman and immediately comes under the thumb of Caldwell and his gang.  Another surprise is in store when Keoma's three half brothers are in the gang, the brothers who hated him and beat him growing up and would like nothing more than to get revenge.  This is a pretty dark film, almost apocalyptic in some ways, and is really a blend of 70s westerns made in the US and everything that made spaghetti westerns so great.  Keoma has a folksy theme song that's a little overused but very haunting at times, lots of flashbacks, and stylized, slow-motion violence right out of a Sam Peckinpah movie.  It's not your typical spaghetti western, but it's still one of the best.In maybe his best role in a spaghetti western, Franco Nero plays Keoma, the half-breed gunman trying to clean up his hometown after the Civil War. With long hair, scruffy beard, and torn clothes, Keoma looks like an extra out of the Mad Max movies!  The humor so typical from Nero's parts aren't there, but it's a great performance.  William Berger matches Nero as Will Shannon, Keoma's father who has seen his family torn apart since the war.  One scene with Keoma and Will talking about how things have changed is worth the price of the DVD alone.  So often given physical roles with little story importance, Woody Strode gets a great part as George, an old man who's known Keoma for years and sides with him upon his return.  Don't worry though, Strode gets some very cool scenes with a bow and arrow. Donald O'Brien is good in a smaller part as Caldwell, the ruthless leader of a murderous gang.  Olga Karlatos plays Lisa, the pregnant woman Keoma saves, with Orso Maria Guerrini, Antonio Marsina, and Joshua Sinclair playing Butch, Lenny, and Sam, Keona's vengeful brothers.The Blue Underground DVD is a must-have for fans of the genre with a beautiful widescreen presentation.  Special features include "Keoma: Legends Never Die," an informative 10-minute interview with Nero about the movie, a commentary with director Enzo Castellari, talent bios, and a trailer.  So for a trippy, but highly enjoyable spaghetti western with great parts for Nero, Berger, and Strode, check out Keoma! </p>

 <p> This one has it all: Franco Nero in his most haunting role (aside from Django), extremely creative camera work, clever editing, Shakespearean themes, Peckinpah-style violence, above average dialogue and, of course, spectacular scenery. The only blemish is the very annoying musical Greek chorus that passes for a soundtrack. A must-own DVD, right up there with the Leone trilogy. </p>
