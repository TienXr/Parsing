 <p> This is a really nice little book about cakeballs. It's short and to the point, but provides some excellent other ideas for what to do with these and overly dried cake. I had no idea that cakeballs contained so much frosting though, so if you are going easy on sugar... these snacks might not be for you! </p>

 <p> Creative and delicious-- whoa sugar attack! :) </p>

I have made these yummy cakeballs and with simple store ingredients they can be made in a flash and then your only job will be to just stand there and take the praise and compliments from the kids or adults you serve them to. This is one "cookbook" I am adding to my collection. You should too. </p>

 <p> Wow I never knew making cakeballs was so easy. I have thrown tons of stale and dry cake away over the years. Had I known about this I could have turned it into something beautiful. Love the decorating ideas and easy to follow steps in this book. Can't wait to try this with my grandkids. </p>

 <p> "Of course, I can't help you if you eat the whole plate of cake balls though." I cracked right up when I read this. I wonder if she had me in mind when she wrote this.A B Mac is a great baker and her recipes are always easy-to-follow. This book is no exception. There are clear step-by-step directions and lots of pictures that make this as easy as pie. This would be a great project for you and your kids to do together. </p>

 <p> If you're looking to impress and make a fabulous tasting treat, this book will show you how! First of all, I love the idea of recycling stale or overbaked cake into these delicious cakeballs. The instructions are very clear and easy with pictures of do's and don'ts so you can get the frosting part right for a great presentation. I'm also going to try bringing them along as gifts or treats for a party. They end up looking so impressive and are a nice sweet treat, without having to eat a whole piece of cake.  The book and instructions are well done and easy to follow, so you can create your own deluxe style cakeballs! </p>

 <p> We had an unexpected visit from the grandkids today and "Cakeballs: How To Make Them," which I downloaded this morning, saved the day. Grandma got out everything needed and even I got involved in creating these wonderful deserts with the grandkids. Best of all was eating these treats after the easy making. I would most certainly recommend "Cakeballs: How To Make Them" to anyone wanting a wonderful experience creating an equally wonderful tasting treat. </p>
