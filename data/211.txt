 <p> This was really boring. It had some good 70s stars and the premise of the story was interesting but, the acting was terrible and the whole Lee Majors leaving his wife thing was actually just depressing. </p>

 <p> In the tradition of the classic disaster films of the 70s- AIRPORT '75, POSEIDON ADVENTURE, TOWERING INFERNO, EARTHQUAKE, etc., STARFLIGHT ONE (aka: THE PLANE THAT COULDN'T LAND) boasts an "all-star cast" of 1970s-80s movie and TV luminaries, including Hal "Barney Miller" Linden as the designer of the title aircraft, and Lee "Six Million Dollar Man" Majors as the pilot. Lauren Hutten co-stars as a passenger. STARFLIGHT ONE is a super-sonic mega jet on its maiden voyage (2hrs from Los Angeles to Australia). Of course, things go terribly awry, and remarkably soon too, as hurtling space junk threatens to destroy the plane! Things get especially fun when the pilot is forced to fly too high, resulting in zero gravity! Yep, it's floating time! STARFLIGHT ONE is hopelessly caught in the Earth's orbit! Meanwhile, the ground crew -along w/ a cranky old Ray Milland (MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES, PREMATURE BURIAL, FROGS) grumbling and frowning- is helpless! A space shuttle is dispatched to refuel the ship. An airlock is set up between the two. Oh no! It comes loose, shooting an extraneous character into space! Poor what's-his-name. After seeing enough of these films, you can pretty much guess what's going to happen next. This one's by the numbers. It also suffers from several long stretches of dullness w/ no action at all. Things finally get (somewhat) interesting when Linden is sealed in a coffin (!!) and carried by astronauts to the shuttle. Eventually, a long tube is connected for the passengers to crawl about a hundred yards to the shuttle. Shockingly, this leads to catastrophe! In the S1 cockpit, Lee Majors and Lauren Hutten reconnect emotionally. Hal Linden devises a bold, risky rescue plan. It's a one in a million chance for survival! Oh! The humanity! At 1 hr. and 55 min., STARFLIGHT ONE feels endless! Good luck... </p>

 <p> This spin on science fiction travel was ahead of its time, accidentally trapping a high-atmospheric shuttle in a weightless orbit above the earth. Good acting and casting. High suspense. A recommended and entertaining movie. </p>

 <p> Both manned space flight and routine intercontinental air travel have occurred within the last one hundred years of our history.  And as the success of the space shuttle program from 1981 to 2011 shows us, it is not entirely out of the possibility that in some of our own lifetimes, routine sub-orbital flight of the hypersonic variety might occur as well.  But as with any technology of this kind, there are always dangers.  This is the premise of the made-for-TV science fiction/air disaster movie STARFLIGHT ONE, which first aired on ABC-TV on February 27, 1983.The premise of what some might call an extension of the Airport films of the 1970s is that of a hypersonic aircraft, capable not only of breaking the sound barrier (like the Concorde, which was unfortunately grounded in 2000), but of also reaching very high into the atmosphere to sub-orbital heights.  Tests conducted on the craft's rockets, which propel it to the heights necessary for trans-global travel, however, prove unsatisfactory to the craft's designer (Hal Linden), but the head (Ray Milland) of the aerospace firm that built Starflight insists on it launching on time for its maiden voyage from Palmdale International Airport, in the desert north of Los Angeles, to Sydney, Australia.  The craft, captained by Lee Majors, with help from his fellow crewmen (Michael Sachs; Gary Bayer), initially operates as it should; but an illegal rocket launch from Australia, in which the rocket self-destructs, scatters debris in the path of the plane; and when a piece of debris penetrates the part of the craft where the rocket connections are, Starflight soars much higher than it was ever intended to go.  And once the rockets burn out, the craft and its sixty passengers find themselves stranded in zero gravity at a height of 87.5 miles above the ground, and just slightly above the lid of Earth's atmosphere.  In effect, they are trapped in space.Attempts to get Starflight One's passengers off are fraught with peril; and several of them do perish.  Linden, however, who was also onboard and who knows what the plane can do, manages to get back down to the ground to assist in efforts being coordinated with NASA and their space shuttle Columbia to get fuel back into the aircraft and get it down before its orbit decays, and to allow for repairs on the damaged rocket cables.  The one problem is that, because Starflight wasn't designed for space flight, it doesn't have a heat shield to protect it; thus, the possibility of both the craft and its crew incinerating is extremely real.  Thus, one more trump card needs to be played.Sometimes compared (quite erroneously) to the 1982 big screen comedy AIRPLANE II: THE SEQUEL, STARFLIGHT ONE is actually an extension of the AIRPORT films (including 1977's AIRPORT `77, which this film's director Jerry Jameson directed), combined with the 1969 big-screen sci-fi melodrama MAROONED, in which three astronauts find themselves stranded in their spacecraft high above the Earth when its retro-rockets refuse to work properly.  The movie has the usual disaster film line-up of stars for this, including Lauren Hutton, Tess Harper, Robert Webber, Gail Strickland, George DiCenzo, Terry Kiser, Pat Corley, Peter Jason, and Stephen Keep; but for the most part, the usual soap opera sub-plots are kept to a bare minimum.  And although not all the situations are really all that plausible (for one, neither Columbia nor its sister shuttles could ever be made ready to launch in the time needed to save Starflight One before her orbit decays), or its special effects completely believable (a rescue tunnel used in one rescue operation that looks like a rubber vacuum hose), most of it is admittedly quite good within the limits of a made-for-TV film, mainly because they were supervised by STAR WARS special effects guru John Dykstra.  The music score by Lalo Schifrin (BULLITT; COOL HAND LUKE) works pretty good, as well.With its attendant flaws and its obvious made-for-TV origins (it was released theatrically overseas), STARFLIGHT ONE nevertheless has enough stuff to recommend it, especially given that hypersonic and sub-orbital passenger flights are slowly but surely approaching the day when they will become real.  As this film amply demonstrates, and as the tragedies of Challenger (in 1986) Columbia (in 2003), and Apollo 204 (in 1967) demonstrated all too well in real life, there are also inherent risks in this kind of technological ambition as well. </p>

 <p> I like Lee Majors in this role, the irony is the late and great Space Shuttle Columbia. Starflight One is a popcorn movie. There aren't alot of splashy special effects that will wow you. It did for me entertain and that was worth the price I paid for VHS copy. I am surprised why a DVD version isn't availabe. Then again it cost to transfer an old movie twenty something years old. For my taste I liked it. </p>

 <p> Good actors, borderline acting in this low budget movie.  Great premiss but i'm sorry to say not well done, story line skips parts of the story. IT's good to have an imagination for this one. It needs lots of technical help. Lots of mistakes for any savvy viewer. It missed the mark in my book. </p>

 <p> Lauren Hutton and Lee Majors and then Hal Lindon in the same TV movie?  Yes, please.I don't want to spoil it for you but the Space Shuttle Columbia makes like 10 take offs and landings in the span of 8 hours by the clock in the movie.  At one point there's even what looks like a Space snake.  You have to watch it to get what I'm talking about.  If you like cheese then this one's for you. </p>

 <p> This movie may or may not have been inspiration for the 1982 parody AIRPLANE! II -- THE SEQUEL, but it does stand out as unique of the genre of Airplane Disaster movies. Man has thought of ways to shorten flying time of great distances throughout the century. First it was the jet; then it was the SST; so, it's only natural for the next idea to be for the airline industry to collaborate with NASA to create an aircraft that could skim our atmosphere as one would skim a stone over water. So, this Airplane Disaster movie has a Sci-Fi flavor to it.TV-stars Hal Linden of BARNEY MILLER fame and Lee Majors head this all-star cast of a flight crippled by debris from a NASA "disaster" causing it to fly higher than intended and its fuel to burn out, leaving it in orbit above the earth. Don't miss this one! </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> A movie you will either love or hate but seems better suited to when you don't care enough to watch the very best. A made-for-TV thriller on par with "Airplane!" and "Airport", the movie is unintentionally hilarious with an outlandish plot. The things you will learn when watching this turkey:1. NASA was NOT consulted on the finer points of shuttle launch windows. Columbia makes three launches within two hour windows. REALLY??? It takes months to plan a launch and NASA just happens to have spare rockets and fuel for all these rescue missions. Who's paying for this?2. Concord-ish plane is capable of leaving the atmosphere to float aimlessly in space. With a hole in its hull, it apparently has enough oxygen for hours of fun without explosive decompression. Heat shield optional.3. Hal Linden can and will be carried in an "airtight" coffin by astronauts to a waiting shuttle even if there's a leak. Leak does not suck him into the vacuum of space.4. Lee Majors will have a mousy wife he ignores shamefully in lieu of his mistress, played by Lauren Hutton. She has no guilt whatsoever and will display all the personality of a cheese slicer. Wife waits around worried about her cheating spouse, but he's too busy trying to save the day while trying to get into cheese slicer's pants.5. Ray Milland will succumb to the temptations of the acting-for-paycheck and will do his best to chew scenery. Too bad most of it's not worth swallowing.6. Rescue will be attempted with inner tube that doesn't seem to be very airtight and resembles a dryer hose. People inside will tumble about uselessly in their socks with no need for oxygen or protective gear to ward off accidental death by vacuum of space or extreme temperatures. No wait. Flimsy material IS flammable and sparks from hole in hull WILL ignite and kill them all! NASA didn't think this through.7. Lee Majors is hero but will spend half the movie sitting or getting underlings to do the dirty work for him while he canoodles and emotionally connects with mistress. Nice. Adultery is such a worthy plot device. Tess Harper will be wasted in this movie and mopes about looking worried and mousy. He's not worthy!!!8. Airplane enters space and weightlessness ensues without ties floating up and Lauren Hutton's spanking 'do stays in place. Hairspray must have been in abundance in 1982. Actors will do their best to pretend to float and grasp aimlessly at ropes and look like they're suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Special effects nonexistent. Not a lot you can do with a twenty-dollar budget.9. Airplane has no heat shield!  Columbia will be used instead. (Unintentional foreshadowing of the 2003 disaster).10. Passengers will be transferred in flight and dumped into empty rocket thingy. No accidents or horrific deaths due to explosive decompression or suffocation will occur 'cause no one thought of it.11. Plot will be tossed out the window in lieu of techno-thriller jibber-jabber and because Lee Majors IS the Six Million-Dollar Man.12. It could work. But only if you're an insomniac in dire need of shuteye or you have a hangover. Otherwise you will laugh your head off at the preposterous plot, lame effects, cheesy love story, and wonder if NASA ever thought of a lawsuit.Three stars just because I grew up in the 80's and missed this when it aired. Good for one-time laugh fest. Everything is dated and seems ancient by today's standards. </p>

 <p> For its time Sratflight was a great two part tv movie airing around the xmas holidays.  It has a great story line but is more of a melodrama with nifty effects for its day.  A plane that gets launched by accident into the orbit of the earth.  Well worth watching if you are a fan of the early disaster movies of the 70's and 80's. </p>

 <p> I don't remember watching this way back in 1983 and that was probably because I was 16 and locked in my room banging my head to Def Leppard and AC/DC. I didn't have time for this much cheese. But watching it 31 year later, it was a nice nostalgia trip. Lee majors is Steve Austin flying a near space airplane that ends up in space and Hal Linden is Barney Miller the project leader who knows her inside out and guides the rescue mission from earth. Actually their character names are different but anyone old enough to have lived through that era will only accept them as those characters. The plot is predictable and the various passengers are all stock actors from tv in the 70s and 80s. But some tension is created even if it is just wondering how the heck they got a famous name like Ray Miland to appear in this as a grumpy old investor. I watched it on a cold day when I was home from work sick. That is the ideal time to watch something like this. Cold medicine helps everything seem better. </p>
