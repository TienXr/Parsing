<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Khrushchev "thaw" filmmaking </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>
  03-23-2005  
<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Alexander Yakovlev, former head of the Russian archives & close Gorbachev advisor, states the following in his book "A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia": "the number of people sentenced between 1923 and 1953 total more than 41 million." 41 MILLION! "More than 994,000 Soviet servicemen were sentenced during the war by military tribunals alone, and of this number more than 157,000 were sentenced to be shot." That said, The Ballad of A SOLDIER is still a good fine (I'll explain the above shortly).  It is extremely well shot; so much so that it has the feel of silent film, wherein emotion, drama, plot, etc. are conveyed through visual means.  That it is subtitled (in English, from Russian dialogue) just adds to the effect.  It's a simple story, but a timeless one---that of what those back home lose when a country's youth goes off to war.  This film, thus, isn't particularly anti-war (or pro-war), or particularly political at all (notwithtanding other reviewers comments to the contrary).  War is not a "good" in of itself, so people have to be provoked into desiring to be a part of it--easier when it's recognized as a just action, of course.  Usually, many just do their duty to their country when called upon to do so; like the Russians did when called upon by their country to do so.  But, unlike in the West, American/British security forces didn't need to shoot their own compatriots to instill disapline & keep forces from surrendering & deserting.  So, let's not get caried away when speaking of "The Soviet soldier."  First of all "The Soviet Man" was a figment of The Communist Party of The Soviet Union's warped mind.  Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians, et al. fought out of duty yes, but also because they were attacked & also because the Othorodox Church appealed to its adherents (as Stalin went into seclusion, having almost a breakdown for upwards of 2 weeks) to resist the Nazi war machine (ignoring Soviet support for Hitler the months previous).  A viewers particulars hasn't much relevence either, morever, as to whether this is a good film or not---ie., you don't have to be Russian to like this film.  It is a fine film as I've indicated above (& contrary to others who think so mostly because they think it conforms to a political view they hold).  In this film a boy goes off to war.  We see a bit of action at the front, as a result from which this soldier is slated to be given a citation for valor.  In lieu of such---this almost accidental hero---asks, however, for a pass to return home to see his mother who he didn't have time to say goodbye to when leaving for the army.  The rest of the film chronicles his journey (mostly by train) east, across the war ravaged USSR; highlighting the importance of family, ties, a sense of place, missed opportunities, and such. Mishaps along the way expend most of his leave, however, resulting in his having to immediately reverse course as soon as he reaches his destination.  So he gets to embrace his mother and make up for not having said goodbye previously, it is but a fleeting moment to savor during a time of extreme difficulty.  Call that anti-war if you like, but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth fighting the Nazis---and no country suffered more than did the USSR from Hitler's war machine.  By all regards give the Russians, Ukrainians, Uzbeks, etc. their due, but keep in mind---as the above figures indicate---that Stalin was almost as afraid (doubting the loyalty to him & Communism) of his own people as he was of Nazi Germany.  By the way too, the monnicker of an "anti-war" film is a misnomer---Across the board, "war is never just" folk are not "anti-war," but simply pacifists.  If other reviewers herein could ignore their heritage and political leanings & let this film stand on its own (commendable) efforts maybe others could more easily decide for themselves whether this film is worth seeing or not. (Do consider reading the book "Babi Yar" for more detail of the havoc the Nazis inflicted in the Ukraine.) Cheers! </p>

 <p> .....The final line in the film, "He was a Russian Soldier" seems to be a tribute to the young men who got seduced by patriotism and honor and threw themselves into the meat grinder of war for love of Country.  This is why some critics labeled the film "Russian Propaganda"......I don't know what was in the Russian mind but I saw the film as an anti-war statement much in the same vein as "All's Quiet on the Western Front.".....In the film the war was generic and was used as background for several touching little vignettes of human relationships.  The acting of the principals, Alyosha Skvortsov (Alesha) and Zhanna Prokhorenko (Shura) was ameturish but this added to the effectness of the film and made it seem more realistic.  The viewer in effect is allowed to eavesdrop on the adventures of two young people caught up in the turmoil of war and the film almost seems like a documentary......The final scene of the mother running through the fields to catch her son before he retuns to war is very emotional.  I have seen grown men turn their heads to hide their tears.  Finally we see the mother looking down the road that took her son back to the war and we know she will never see him again......To see any glory in this wasted sacrifice of youth and human life is perverse. The movie is touching and sad and it condemns war, it shouldn't in any way glorify it. </p>

 <p> By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.comI saw "Ballad of a Soldier" because it was on someones list of the ten best motion pictures ever made. The film lives up that ranking in many ways. I'm not going to tell you the story because others have done that. THIS IS A SUBLIMELY BEAUTIFUL, MUST SEE FILM! Now I know how my mother felt and how millions of mothers felt when they had to send their sons off to war, not knowing if they would ever return.  No other film has ever shown the depth of that love or the love that a soldier has for each day of life, for his home, and for his mother. Did the young soldier also love his country? Probably so but he had no choice about going to war. There were no conscientious objectors or draft dodgers in the Soviet army. Deserters were shot.Though we lost near half a million men in World War 2 and almost every family in the United States was directly affected, we fail to comprehend the scope of that war. The Soviets lost 20 million sons and fathers. There is a cemetery in Leningrad where 2 million men are buried that were killed in one battle. Each grave contains the bodies of 1500 men and the graves stretch as far as the eye can see in two directions.You will love the young soldier and his difficult journey to get home before he must return to the war. You will be moved by the boys innocence in a chance encounter with a girl. The love that develops between them is unmistakable but they must part. What night have been cannot be, because of a horrible war.The ending where the soldier's mother comes running from the fields to say goodbye again to her son is one of the most emotionally moving scenes ever recorded on film.See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute and saveusa.biz </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Sometimes you watch a film and it inhabits you.... it gets under your skin. Ballad of a Soldier is such a film. And sometimes a work of art provides an affirmation of what you've always believed. This too is the case with this remarkable, deeply moving film from Kruschev's Soviet Union.The camerawork is exceptional, the black and white tonality is exquisite, and even though the tale told could be minimalized by labels such as corny and manipulative and obvious, at heart it's a classic story of love desperately trying to survive in the midst of madness. It's riveting - you can't take your eyes off the screen - and it's compelling, in that during this film (and for days after it) the most important thing in your heart will become the hero's reuniting with his love. Deeply moving... and I don't know if I will ever forget this performance by the shimmering Zhanna Prokhorenko.The tragedy of this remarkable film is that it could have been used as an instrument to teach the American people they were being sold a lie by their government. That lie, endlessly hammered into our heads in grade school and junior high, was that "The Russians don't value life like we do."  We were taught to view the Soviets as grey, unattractive potato-like people in shabby clothing who wanted to conquer Main Street America, though it was never really explained to us why they would ever want to do that, especially after losing over 22 million of their own citizens in the last war... (oh I forgot, they don't value life like we do.) We were taught there was a missile gap...with JFK claiming that the Russians had thousands of missiles aimed at our back yards...  which we now know was an enormous and conscious exaggeration (sound familiar?)If every American had had the chance to see this film in the early Sixties and had mustered up the inner strength to speak truth to power, the contemporary history of the United States and the world just might have been different. You could have shown this film to an audience of farmers and their families in Kansas in 1960, and that audience would have seen themselves on the screen. And they would have wept as they left the theatre.The Soviet people were not our enemies. Their government definitely at times was our adversary, but the demonization of the Soviet people by our leaders and our media was and remains absolutely unforgivable, a historical sin.A brilliant, heartwarming and sad film, with a profound lesson not too late for the learning. </p>

 <p> Not a Tractor in Sight </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Comedians used to poke fun at Soviet movies during the Cold War era. The claim was that every Soviet film could be characterized by a single standard plot line--"Boy meets tractor, Boy falls in love with tractor, Boy marries tractor". Now, I'm not sure how accurate the wags were since Soviet films were never shown here, nor ours there. But, given Soviet emphasis on collective farming, and their theory that art should follow politics, that sort of result wouldn't be surprising.Nonetheless, Soviet-made or not, this 1959 humanist gem shines like a proverbial pearl in the night. Sure, the boy and girl are idealized, but were there ever two more charming performers; they even look alike. Moreover, it's that natural glow amidst the seediest surroundings that suggests what some might call a triumph of the human spirit. After years of slickly contrived Hollywood pairings, I was captivated by a warmth and chemistry seemingly so unforced and unrehearsed that I marvel at how it was done. In my book, it's one of the great compelling love stories of the big screen.Just as importantly, the movie is anti-war, but subtly so. We do see some devastation and combat, but the real indictment lies elsewhere. It rests with all the potentials cut short by unrelenting demands of the war machine. The boy must return to his unit or risk being shot as a deserter. Thus he must abandon the injured soldier with whom he could have been friends; he must risk losing the love of his life because trains must run on wartime; he must  leave his mother, without even time to fix the leaky roof. But most of all, war demands that he, like so many fine young men, must leave life with a personal potential that will go tragically unrealized. As one of Chukrai's effects brilliantly illustrates, war is indeed a world turned upside down.Also, there are the stunning visuals. Those vast Russian steppes may be flat and boring. Nonetheless, the corresponding big sky makes a magnificent backdrop for heroic low-angle shots of those dwelling amidst the vastness. Then there's that long dusty road at film's end, leading off into a great unknown that Alyosha must now travel. In contrast are the teeming crowds at the railway station, looking nothing like Hollywood in their simple cloth dresses and shirts. And what concern with fancy hair-do's can the women have when their hair is bound down with knotted kerchiefs. All in all, it's a revealing look at what could be called the Russian peasantry of the time.No, the movie clearly doesn't come from the ministry of propaganda. Still, there are concessions. Note how cooperative strangers become no matter how initially cranky they are. The army officers especially are portrayed as understanding and non-threatening. Nobody is depicted negatively, except maybe the disloyal wife. Not even the Nazi enemy responsible for 20 million Russian dead is mentioned, let alone, vilified. No, the real antagonist here is war itself; the point is not stated, but it is shown to an uncommonly moving degree. The dedication at film's end may be to the Russian soldier, but the subtext throughout aims at the universal, regardless of time, place, or nationality.Thus 50 years later, the movie remains a timeless humanist classic. And with it, I think Chukrai deserves a place alongside the early masters of Soviet film, that is, before the Stalinist tyranny descended. Now, I have nothing against tractors. In fact, I wish Hollywood would feature more such life-affirming inventions than the exploding cars they so love and worship. Nonetheless, I guess I'm glad that here, there's not a single tractor in sight. </p>

 <p> I liked this film most because though it shows the horrors of war, it never looked at war though a political prism. Instead, it stressed upon the human and emotional toll of epic proportion that a war triggers through a series of short stories as part of the young soldier's journey to home. Through his eyes and companions, unfolds the pain, grief, anguish of common people for losing their loved ones. I do not like to categorize this film as 'Foreign'. The language may be Russian, but the story is a universal one. When a war erupts, countless mothers lose their sons, thousands of wives lose their husbands, sisters lose their brothers, daughters lose their fathers - regardless of their national identity. In the end, when we see the mother who keeps waiting for his lost son, we forget if she is a Russian mother or a British mother. The pain is same. This sort of story can be found in abundance in Japan, Poland, Germany, USA - everywhere. The director and script writers have told a very intimate and humane story of colossal wound that a war inflicts on human life and mind - and in a deceptively simple way. A profound and immortal work. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> A rare Soviet treat </p>

 <p> Though little time is spent detailing the front line, World War II is present in the forefront of every scene in "Ballada o Soldate." Why, then, are only two deaths witnessed through the course of this film: that of a Russian soldier who gives up his position and that of a beautiful woman killed by Germans? Why, one might also ask, do the characters, even those in most impoverished conditions, remain as a unit brotherly and optimistic?This story, stripped to its bare-bones plot line, might indicate some very different feelings to someone unfamiliar with "Ballada o Soldate." Private Alyosha Skvortsov, while fighting on the front, has just endured a stroke of luck that both saves his life and destroys two enemy tanks. In reward for his accomplishments, he is given the privilege to take a six-day leave of absence to visit his mother in his hometown. After a long series of detours, he reaches home with only enough time to hug her, say some kind words, and rush back to the front. During this time he has met and fallen in love with a young and equally innocent girl. Then he is killed.Does this sound like a happy story to you? When I first viewed this film, I anticipated one of a thousand things that would go wrong from the moment Alyosha left on his journey. The longer it took for the hammer to fall, it seemed the harder such a blow must be to such an unrealistic boy - for Alyosha is truly depicted as innocent as a child. This is a punch I was amazed to find was never dealt.This is the difference that makes "Ballada o Soldate" an important film today. Faced with numerous gruesome depictions of war in story and in film, "War Is Hell" seems to be the popular slogan in the 21st century American mind. This was obviously not the case in the Soviet Union, when this movie was first released. While "Ballada o Soldate" remains fairly realistic in scene depiction, character reactions to such hardships are unfalteringly positive. Even at the end, when the audience - and perhaps the private himself - knows that Alyosha is returning to his death does the mood remain brave and patriotic. Propagandistic, maybe, but "Ballada o Soldate" insists war is not Hell; war is a duty. </p>

 <p> The Soviet Cinema produced two unforgettable filmic gems during the Fifties. Ivan's childhood (Andrei Tarkovsky) and this one.The narrative pulse, the visual aesthetic, the stuning landscapes, the employment of the camera are a feast for your senses.Chuckhrai made his masterwork with notable assertiveness, a film that could have fallen into a simple account of the affective memories of a teenager at the Fornt of War. But the narative thread supported a movie that grows and grows before our eyes with organical flow and genuine artistic commitment.That's why this movie is included by Facets as one of the 600 Best Foreign Films ever, without including the nomination as Best Foreign Film for the members of the Academy.This is without discussion a towering masterwork. Don't miss it by any pretext. </p>

 <p> The details of the story have been covered well in other reviews, so I'll pass on that aspect. This DVD is flawlessly rendered. Every outlet should apply the same standards to their work as did Criterion in this release. The result is a crisp, detailed, CLEAN, B&W; video and soundtrack that looks right at home on the best of the current crop of high end Entertainment centers.The story is neither  pacifist (like "All quiet"), or gung-ho die for the motherland in it's application. It focuses more on the human side of the call to arms than any film I have ever viewed. Faced with the knowlege that Hitler was exterminating their fellow countrymen in order to provide "living space" for the future Reich, many millions of Russians answered the call to defend their existence. Many millions died before the war was over. Despite it's soviet origin, this film does a wonderful job of singling out just one individual, following his life through the ordeal of war, and giving us a glimpse of the true cost of the sacrifice made by the masses of young soldiers who have died defending their homelands around the globe.The dialog is outstanding. The subtitles are remarkably good, and in general, the film will make you laugh, cry, and pretty much stay focused on the screen until the you have watched everything offered on the DVD. Get this movie, you won't regret it. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> When this Russian film was made in 1959, it was the middle of the Cold War.  American audiences certainly didn't see it.  If we had, it would have softened our impressions of Russians, who were always depicted as cruel monsters whose only desire was to bury America.  And yet, WW2 was devastating for them as it was fought on their soil and so many died.  "Ballad of a Soldier" is the story of one such soldier.We first meet 19-year old Alyosha as he is cowering in a foxhole on the front.  We can identify with his fear at the German tanks that are advancing.  He runs to a machine gun and shoots at the tanks.  To his surprise, he hits a tank and destroys it.  He keeps shooting and manages to destroy a second tank.  All of a sudden he's a hero and his commanding officer wants to give him a medal.  "Please, sir" he begs.  "Instead of a medal, please give me one day's leave to see my mother."  The hard-hearted officer is touched, and gives the young man a six-day pass.It would be a two-day trip each way even at the best of times. But now it is wartime. And it's a difficult journey.  Along the way we meets a one-legged soldier who's reluctant to face life, a lovely young woman who Alyosha begins to love, an unfaithful wife who he shames, and old man who he gives hope.  He has to bribe his way into a train.  And is traveling on another train when a bridge is destroyed.  But he is determined to make it to his village to see his mother, even if it is just to give her one big hug before he has to return to the front.  It's a wonderful story, full of setbacks and tension and just plain human feelings.Filmed it black and white, and a mere 89 minutes long, it contains images of Russia that Americans rarely see. The countryside is devastated, but yet there's a spirit of a hearty people full of grit and determination to survive.  It's a sad story too, and bittersweet.  By the end of the film I was sobbing out loud.  This is a fine film.  Highly recommended. </p>

 <p> The (in)human face of satanic violence (war) </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Grigori Chukhray's movie is still highly topical. It is one of the best anti-war films ever made. It reveals in a most outspoken way the human faces behind the bloodshed. It shows how war violence is not limited to the battlefield, but provokes also physical and mental havoc everywhere in the countries involved. People lose their homes, their possessions and even their country. People bleed also psychologically through broken or strained relationships and family ties. Women have to do a man's work at home.As a contrast to the satanic war machinery, Grigori Chukhray scripted a pure love encounter. But, it also didn't last very long.Ideologically, this movie is a perfect example of Marxist art: it has a positive hero, who is also a type, a representative of a particular class (a soldier, a `Russian' soldier).`Ballad of a Soldier' stands in sharp contrast to the actual avalanche of so-called blockbusters preaching an unacceptable and shameful gospel of violence. `Ballad of a Soldier' in its way is also a blockbuster, but with `big' sentiments, preaching love instead of hate, respect instead of inhumanity and family ties instead of random killings.`Ballad of a Soldier' is a `big' movie. A must see. </p>

 <p> Ballad of a Soldier is an exceptional work of art; and when other reviewers state that films rarely if ever get better than this they are right. The acting is superb and the cinematography works wonders for this film. The script is well written and the casting was perfectly done. The plot moves along at just the right pace with enough room for solid character development without ever becoming too slow or boring in any way whatsoever. In addition, the choreography was very thoughtfully done.When the film begins, we quickly meet a front line Russian soldier during World War Two, Alyosha Skvortsov. (Vladimir Ivashov). With scarcely any equipment and no one to help him, Alyosha still disables two enemy tanks on his own; and he is rewarded with a decoration. However, Alyosha prefers a rarely given leave instead of the decoration; and his commanding officer grants him six days off just so long as he returns on time. Alyosha is overjoyed to be able to return to his village, see his mother and repair the leaking roof on their home; and he has every intention of returning promptly to the front.Alyosha's trip home soon becomes much more eventful than he planned. He runs into a number of people all of whom give us a slice of life portrait at the high cost and futility of war. There's the wounded veteran Vasya (Yevgeni Urbansky) who has lost a leg in the fighting but who is taken back with open arms by his wife (Elza Lezhdey) in a powerful scene; and Alyosha meets and gradually falls in love with the beautiful Shura (Zhanna Prokhorenko) who is also a stowaway on the same train Alyosha takes part of the way to visit his mother. There are other very fine performances by V. Markova as Liza, the wife of a soldier named Pavlov (Gennadi Yukhtin); Vladimir Pokrovsky, the father of that same soldier and Valentina Telegina does a very good job with her cameo as an exhausted elderly woman truck driver trying to just get by and live using her very old truck; she gives Alyosha a lift but it isn't long before Alyosha has to get out and push every time the truck hits thick mud.Alyosha meets other huge challenges with bravery and heroism; it's practically impossible not to see the hero in him by the time the film is over. The ending is a real tear-jerker; and I rarely if ever shed a tear while watching a movie!The DVD comes with an audio interview with director/co-writer Grigori Chukhrai as well as the two stars of the film, Vladimir Ivashov and Zhanna Prokhorenko. As you listen to the interview still photos from the film appear on the screen. The movie itself is in Russian and there are English subtitles.Ballad of a Soldier should be mandatory viewing for any film student; and the glorious black and white footage only adds to the emotional impact of this motion picture. I also recommend this film for film buffs and people interested in World War Two. </p>

 <p> That really boils down to a regular soldier who simply loves his mother and seems open to settling down with some nice little peasant woman.  Destroying two tanks earns him a week of leave, which involves several small adventures and life lessons.  The genius here is going under the material and exploring all the quiet subtle ways people managed to stay light hearted during the horrors of war. </p>

 <p> A mother stares down a long country road, waiting for a son who will never return. This is the most hauntingly powerful, heart-rending image in this landmark film full of many memorable images.I'm very sorry to say that it was only this week that I viewed this movie for the first time.But perhaps it was meant to be. I have a son Alyosha's age. I am proud to say that the two are quite similar: tall, blond, handsome, kind, sensitive. In this time in the US, with Bush's war, I do think about my son going off to fight in a foreign land. I dread him going; I've urged him to enlist in one of the "alternatives" like Navy or Coast Guard. When I was his age we faced the draft for Vietnam. I was one of the lucky ones who had enough dough to go to school and thus secure deferments each year. Others went in my place, for which I do have guilt. It was not fair at all.Knowing Bush, I am a bit surprised that the draft has not been reinstated. All of these thoughts came to me as I watched this wonderfully simple yet tremendously powerful film.One of the tests of a great film, to me, is this: will the pictures themselves be of interest, even without sound? In Ballad of A Soldier, the images are by turns lyrical, awe-inspiring, gritty, poetic, unflinching, romantic. Director Chukrai is a true artist.Forget the propaganda tag. It's a universal story of the tragedy of separation and loss. We aren't literally told or shown what happens to Alyosha, which was very wise. All we need to know is that he does not return home. This is the tragedy.This is a truly eloquent masterpiece which stands the test of time. It is a worthy inclusion on any "Best Of" list </p>

 <p> The Bottom Line:A simple story that's also very moving and impeccably made, Ballad of a Soldier tells the story of a Soviet soldier who's given leave but watches as his furlough rapidly diminishes before he even gets home; with wonderful direction and a perfect conclusion, it's a film to remember. </p>

 <p> As time goes on, I keep returning to films that exquisitely portray the human condition: films like "The Bicycle Thief," "Forbidden Games," "The Official Story," "Boy," and "Ballad of a Soldier," to name a few. When I first saw "Ballad of a Soldier,"  I also had under my belt many of the masterpieces of the new wave films from Europe and Asia in the 50s and early 60s. This brilliant film and "The Cranes Are Flying" put another face on the Cold War for me.Most in the West think the United States and allies "won" WWII. Nothing could be further from the truth. Germany invaded Russia on June 22, 1941, and proceeded to destroy their country and over 28 million Russian citizens and soldiers. The battles on the Eastern Front were of such breadth and scope that no comparison is possible in history. For example, in the famous 1943 battle of Kursk (remember the Russian sub?), up to 6,000 total tanks battled over a 200-mile front that resulted in a million deaths. This adventure took about 10 days. Stalingrad alone was the beginning of the end for the Germans, resulting in 160,000 dead and 500,000 taken prisoner. The savagery there was literally unspeakable and horrible, and the losses by the Russians were horrendous. Behind the Russians was the butcher Stalin, and in front of them were the Germans, yet in spite of these evils, the Russian people rose up with an incredible sense of protecting their motherland. When the war in the East was over in 1945, the Red Army had destroyed, disabled, or captured 607 German and Axis divisions; Americans and allies, from Africa to Berlin, destroyed a total of 167 enemy divisions. Their total deaths numbered around 8 million. Total American deaths in Europe numbered around 300,000.I mention these facts to belie the notion that most reviewers seem apologetic that this film contained " soviet propaganda," as if that were a discrediting thing. From the Russian point of view, they won the war, and the numbers easily prove it. The Americans invaded Western Europe and courageously fought into Germany. But, without their airpower and bombing of German civilians into the Stone Age, or without the decimation caused by the Russians of 2/3s of German ground forces, D-Day would have been a disaster.This is the background for this film, and its utter faithfulness to any Russian's basic sense of themselves, their country, and their culture rings true throughout. Not to be missed! </p>

 <p> This warm and sentimental film is romantic, though also accurate portrayal of WW2 Soviet Union.  While surely propaganda in its own since, it has enough truth and warmth to make it a classic.  The only part I found a little hard to believe was the beginning where our hero manages to knock out two Panzer Mark IVs (or are they Tiger IIs) with an anti-tank rifle!  This was not a Russian version of the USA bazooka or German Panzerfaust.  This weapon could only knock out lightly armored vehicles, and possibly throw a track on a tank, but knocking out two German medium tanks with this weapon was certainly far-fetched to me! It would have been better if our hero manned a Soviet 76mm anti-tank gun in a moment of crisis and got his two German tanks that way!Failing that this is a lovely film, which shows just how hard life was in the soviet Union at that time, both for the front-line soldier and civilians as well. While propaganda it is, its not the kind to offend, and I'll wager its good honest morality would have been approved even during the Cold War era in the States!  A fine classic, worth seeing for its value, and unique Soviet perspective of the Great Patriotic War. </p>
