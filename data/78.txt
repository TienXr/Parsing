 <p> You have to turn the shaft knobs TIGHT to keep the poles from dropping (even when unloaded), but otherwise I like this.  The first few times I thought I had the knob tight enough (with the tension I was accustomed to on my Manfrotto standard 9-ft stands) and the moment I let go of the pole, it dropped down.  It's nice and compact and good for light loads.  I can't imagine that the Manfrotto Nano is much nicer for nearly twice the price. </p>

 <p> These are really great stands and a viable replacement for the Manfrotto 5001B Nano stands at around half the price. The knobs need a good tightening to stay in place but work great. A solid piece of kit when you need ultra portable stands. </p>

 <p> Great stands for the price. </p>

 <p> I bought these as supplemental light duty gear and they do not disappoint.  I use them quite frequently with small LED panels.  Great as an interview light or hair light.  Note that the knobs need a little extra tightening -- that would be my only issue, but minor enough to still warrant 5 stars.  For what it is intended to do, it is excellent. </p>

 <p> Excellent light duty portable stand </p>

 <p> I do like this product.  I do mostly location photography, so the lightness of this is perfect.  It doesn't feel to be very sturdy, but for the price, I can deal with that.  It's easy to setup and tear back down to size.  I trust this product with my flashes, etc. to make sure they don't fall to the ground.  Since it's very light, you will have to anchor it down when it's windy outside. </p>

 <p> Does the job fairly well... </p>

 <p> I have numerous stands, they all have a purpose, and these serve the purpose of being the least obtrusive and portable. I find myself preferring these when i reach for a stand.What i like:-Stores into 21&#34;, which if inserted diagonally, will fit into carryon size luggage-Goes just high enough to get a high over the shoulder of a sit down interview-Sturdy enough for small to even some medium size/weight lights. max load of 3.5lb i'll believe.-Almost all metal-Close to half the price of the equivalent manfrotto.What's nitpickable:-Taller would be nice, if they added another section and thickened everything up-Knobs not metal, and do require snug tightening to ensure it's locked-If it were just 1.5inches shorter, it would fit strait into carryon size luggage, no diagonal needed.Light stands aren't a complicated thing, so that pretty much sums this one up. The manfrotto will get you a bit better quality if you don't mind the extra $25ish, i somehow got two of these for $30something total, i think it was a price mistake.But anyways, if you're shooting with small lights like LEDs, or totas/DPs/etc.. these are great to have around, be sure to have some taller stands too, but for shorter needs, these are great. Just don't expect to use any sort of gobo/extension arm on them. The top tube isn't thick enough. Though i did manage to get a flag/reflector holder arm to attach to one of the lower sections. I might have used some gaff tape on that one... don't recall. Lastly, you can add some extra height to these, as there are some light stand height extenders out there, but i'd be sure to only use those for small lights. </p>

 <p> Unless i really need my bigger stands, i prefer these every time </p>

 <p> This is a great product. Very portable and will fit in my overhead suitcase for travel. Exactly what I wanted. Works well. No problems with it.9/5/13 Edit: Since purchasing two of these I thought I would weigh back it with a report on durability.On mine I found that after using them for a couple months the plastic knobs all formed stress cracks in them from tightening. Once the stress cracks appear be very careful from that point on when tightening them or the plastic knobs may fall off all together! I used a drop of super glue on each of the cracks to help hold them together longer. The plastic is evidently very cheap. </p>

 <p> Cowboystudio Stand- Perfect! </p>

 <p> I really like this stand. My Manfrotto 5001B light stand is very similar. Just as the other reviewer has stated, the columns are thicker and it about 2 inches longer folded and about 5 inches shorter fully extended than the Manfrotto (see photos I have uploaded). I really do like the tightening clamps on it cause they seem to be made of metal not plastic. There only seems to be about a $10 difference between this stand and the Manfrotto, so if you don't mind the extra storage space and don't plan on needing the additional height. Then this is a good buy. </p>

 <p> Good Buy </p>

 <p> I have not used it for a shoot yet, but opening it up it felt light but sturdy. It collapses smaller than some of my 5 ft stands. Will be using it this weekend and will update on its use, and portability. </p>

 <p> Great value </p>

 <p> This is a great, portable size stand that is every bit as sturdy a the Manfrotto 501B at a fraction of the price </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> For the size and money, it beats the Manfrotto </p>

 <p> stand works well and it's small enough to strap on backpack. when used with my wireless remotes it lets me get  a different lighting angle on macros and "portraits on the trail". plenty strong. </p>

 <p> I just got a couple of these for a gig. Just doing a checkout, one of the clamps that stops the masts from sliding down brok under normal tightening pressure. NOT HAPPY.The stand does not go 7 ft. It's more like 6 and a half feet at best.The legs scare me from a legal standpoint. They're very thin, and fragile looking. Like a cheap music stand kids use at home. I would not trust these with anything that hangs out over the side like a softbox, boom. You should only use these with the lightest gear in your inventory. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Convenient, but not very well built. </p>

 <p> Solid stand. It works great and is quite a bit cheaper than the manfrotto version. I use Manfrotto for my tripod legs and heads, but their stands are a bit on the expensive side when it comes to JUST holding a light. </p>

 <p> Works great </p>
