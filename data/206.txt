 <p> I was in my 20's when the original transformers cartoon and toys came out. I never really got into the original show because of this. I found this series by accident and only kept watching because it was CGI done by the same company that did Reboot.I found that the stories were not dumbed down to make it "kid friendly" it was just good sci-fi. </p>

 <p> BW was getting its feet under it in the first season. That was readily apparent in the voice talent getting a feel for its respective characters, and CGI errors that weren't made later on.Still, the first season is very solid. It shows the characters thinking their way out of tight spots, dealing with the realities of war, and also includes links to the original Transformers series. (I.E., the appearance of Starscream, mentions of the "Great War", and so on.)***Spoilers***One of my personal favorite episodes is "Dark Voyage." It shows Rhinox, Cheetor, Rattrap and Dinobot rendered blind, damaged and low on power in an Energon explosion. Under attack from Waspinator and Terrorsaur, Rhinox has his team "picture a targeting grid in your head, like the one we use in practice simulations." Using this technique, Rhinox is able to tell his team where to fire, and fight off the Preds. A perfect example of using your head when the usual methods don't work.I recommend this for any tran fan, old and new. The CGI might take some getting used to, particularly if you're used to conventional animation, but once you do, the show will definitely stand out. </p>

 <p> Beast wars season one has a feel that it is getting it feet under it.  You are not sure if the series wants to be a childrens show or a nostalgic flash back to the generration one charcters.  However the series decides not to pander to childer and instead starts to make several incredible decisions about the series.1.  It will be set up for adults.  As such characters will die.2.  Moral issues will be faught and sometimes good will do "evil" acts to survive.3.  Every episode will build on each other.  Their is an incredible continuity that is started in season one.  This continuity is carried all the way into season three.4.  Scale, reality, and believable sci-fi are present in the show.  Things happen due to a scientific reason.  This may be a fantastical science as we see but they still make the show as hard edged as possible.All in all a great season.Enjoy:David </p>

 <p> People say that everyone is wild on the inside, but I don't think that they had robots in mind. The "Transformers" are back and, in my opinion, better than ever! The Autobots and Decepticons are long gone.  This story is about their descendents, the smaller, but just as powerful, Maximals and Predicons. The Predicons steal an ancient Golden Disc from the Maximals and try to get away, but they are chased by a Maximal exploration ship. Both of the ships do battle and, during the battle, both are sent back in time millions of years. Both ships crash down onto a strange planet that looks like Earth, and even has the same animals that Earth has, but the planet has TWO moons! All Transformers, both Predicon and Maximal, survive the crash, but there is a problem. The planet is toxic to them and in order to survive, they scan the bodies of animals in the area and take their forms for protection. Now, both sides try desperately to destroy the other in a war for survival...a war for honor...a war of beasts.NOTE: Sorry for the long review, but when I start writing, I am hard to stop. Thanks for reading and I hope you purchase and enjoy "Beast Wars: The Complete First Season". </p>

 <p> One of my favorite series to watch when I was younger, I was very pleased to see it come out on DVD. The first season is even better then I remember with a great combination of character development, humor, and action. The voice acting and visual presentation is great, though a bit rocky from the start. Beast Wars had a lot of firsts in the world of animation so one could only expect a few problems, though there aren't any by the end of this season.On the episodes contained in this box set you get to see how it all started. You get to see each and every character's personality change as rivalries evolve and the plot twists more and more. Memmorable episodes include Rhynox nearly destroying the Predacons when he was turned into one, Dinobot's duel with Optimus Primal, the return of Starscream (my favorite G1 character), and what the thrilling finale where the transformers dealt with the wrath of the alien beings that haunted the back of their minds.All this greatness and there are still two more seasons worth. Getting this box set is worth being a good introduction to the series and it's characters if nothing else and is a must to complete the collection. The only part I consider myself a bit of a downside is that it was made by people that hated transformers themselves. If it was that good by people who hated what it was based off, imagine how good it could've been had people who actually liked the franchise created it! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> A funny thing has happened to a lot of the old Transformers fans as they have aged.  They have gotten young again.By that I mean, they like to relive their childhood by hunting down the old cartoons and buying the old toys or perhaps buying some of the new toys and/or watching some of the new Transformers shows.  A lot of them do this because they now have the money to invest in Transformers that they didn't have as children and many also want to expose their own kids to something they grew up with.However, a lot of old "Transfans" won't accept anything but the old toys and the old shows and aren't big fans at all of Aramada, Cybertron, Energon, etc.  Beast Wars however made quite a few converts.Let me make it clear that this definitely isn't a direct continuation of the original cartoon and toy line.  Your first clue would be the animation when watching the shows.  It is known as CGI, meaning it is computer generated 3-D animation.  The first time I saw Transformers in CGI it was hard to adjust to, but after a few shows it seemed quite natural.The second adjustment is the difference of the characters and the story.  For one, the main Transformers in the series don't turn into cars and planes and they aren't even Autobots and Decepticons.  Instead, this series focuses on the Maximals and Predacons, which are the descendants of the original heroes and villians many of us grew up with.The plotlines themselves have a little something for everyone.  They appeal to kids because they do have a decent amount of humor and "fun" characters involved.  There is also a lot of classic good vs. evil, and the depth of the scripts is far greater than most would expect, yet there is enough action to make it enjoyable even for children who don't always understand all of the concepts.Most importantly, the show manages to both stay true to the original G1 theme, while somehow expanding it and still maintaining it's very own unique identity.  Several G1 characters are either mentioned or make an appearance but them showing up doesn't steal the show, it just adds to the story and actually helps some of the regular characters develop.Perhaps the best analogy I could use here is Star Trek compared to Star Trek - The Next Generation.  Both Beast Wars and TNG weren't afraid to be their own shows, but they certainly didn't forget where they came from either.  Both shows also attracted a whole new group of fans while winning over many fans of the originals.If you decide to own just one Transformers DVD set, this would make a great choice.If you want to check Beast Wars out without buying a complete season, look for the 10th Anniversary figures now available in stores.  If you are lucky enough to find the Waspinator figure, the DVD included with that figure, "Possession" is arguably the best of the entire series.I have also reviewed Beast Machines and the original G1 cartoon so check out those reviews as well. </p>

 <p> Only transformers prime comes close to this show. At first I wasn't sure where the characters came from or who they were, but that gets cleared pretty fast. The animation is very good, considering this was when cgi was first being used, and then only some. The characters were fleshed out much more then the original show, and given much different surroundings. The planet is not reveled as Earth until season two.I also enjoyed seeing Dinobot( not to be confused with the Dinobots form the first show) change and grow as the dhow went on, even if he does eat his clone. I recommend this to any transformers fans, or anyone just looking for a really good cartoon. </p>

 <p> I didnt really give the beast wars a chance when they were on Tv because i was suck a G1 fan. But years later I have picked them all up on DVD and now realise how well they play into the G1 continuity. In fact the first couple of seasons are much better than the G1 cartoon. The stories and characters are very well set up in this long first season (twice as long as the following seasons). The great thing about this season which is sets it apart from the others is the pacing, it does not seem cluttered or crammed at all. Superb intelligent action ina  great scifi series witha  mix of ongoing stories and oneshots. Pick this up!!! </p>

 <p> A new beginning for a new kind of Transformers </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> From the creators of the computer animated series Reboot, Beast Wars premiered in the mid-90's with a different spin on the Transformers lore.  The series begins with the heroic Maximals (the descendants of the Autobots) and the villainous Predicons (the descendents of the Decepticons) crash landing on what appears to be Earth after the dinosaurs became extinct and brief signs of civilization began to stir.  Instead of transforming into vehicles, the bots transform into various animals and beasts (hence the title), as they do battle over this first season.  Though there were decidedly two camps when Beast Wars premiered (fans of the classic Transformers series either enjoyed it or hated it, with myself originally being one of the haters), there is something about the show that just grows on you.  The characterizations offer all sorts of odes to the classic series, as the Maximals consist of leader Optimus Primal, young Cheetor, motormouth Rattrap, former Predicon-turned Maximal Dinobot, scientific officer Rhinox, and eventually newer members Tigertron and Air Razor.  The Predicons offer leader Megatron, the treacherous Tarantulas, Black Arachnia (who would go on to play a vital role in the series' development), Scorpinok, the crazy and annoying Waspinator, and Terasaur.  The show only gets better with each progressing episode, and the season ending cliffhanger will have you begging for more as a heroic sacrifice leads to the question: just who is behind all this?  All in all, if you're a Transformers fan in the least bit, Beast Wars is certainly worth a look, as it expands the Transformers mythos, and is an important chapter as well. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> You've gotta give credit to the creators of Beast wars. This show potrays what it does best and that's making you laugh at the dimwited villains and bickering heros. Done quiet well for a CG aminated series, Best wars is certaintly one of the strangest spin off's in the Transformer's universe. The first episode (a two part arc) simply introduces the characters and their delima, the music isn't all that great unless you like blaring giutars and jungle-sounding music. It does have its moments though. After landing on a unknown planet the transformers learn that there is far too much energon (a sorce of energy they use to power their ships and cybertron) on the planet for their robitic bodies to handle so they simply find themselves "beast modes" to travel in and only use their "Robot modes" to do battle with their enemy.Also their not called Autobots or Decpticons, instead their called "Maximals" and "Predicons" to cater to their animal forms and in each episode they search for energon to power their damaged ships in the hopes that they will be able to return to cybertron. The Maximals also search for their comrades that were sent into orbt when their exploration shuttle crahsed landed. The voice acting in the show in done very well, be warned there is only english aduio on this DVD and no extra features, but there are enough episodes (seven I believe) on each DVD keep you harping about that. The animations for the characters as execptionally great although it can be clunky at times. The plot is semi-complex and can get rather confusing as the show progesses but everything reveals itself in a very slow pace. Despite this beast wars is a great show, but jaded-twenty-something's will not be pleaseed by the fact that their animals instead of vehicles, but this shouldn't bother anyone with an open mind. </p>

 <p> Just a quick technical issue resolution before I head off for tax class.For those that bought this set during its first printing, you may notice that the DD 5.1 Surround track on Ep. 1 "Beast Wars, part 1" and Ep. 5 "Chain of Command", all on Disc 1 have snaps and popping noises through-out them.Well, Rhino Customer Service is aware (through me, actually) of this apparent release-wide problem and will sometime in the near future print up and offer fixed replacement discs.All one needs to do is to contact Rhino's customer service rep, Mack Dunlop at 1-800-546-3670, and he'll put you on a list to call when they're ready to ship the replacements.On a side note, I have asked him when he expects Season 2 & 3 to be released and currently it's not on their production schedule, but he expects that maybe by Summer 2004. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Sort of like a fungus.  The best way to enjoy Beast Wars is to think of it like a drinking game.  Every time they zoom in to Cheetor's animal face looking roundeyed and surprised, drink! Every time someone says "beast wars" like they're expecting a papier-mache duck to drop down like it's the Secret Word, drink! Every time Rattrap says something racially insensitive to Dinobot, drink! Every time Megatron ends a sentence with a long drawn out 'Yeeeess' or 'Noooo'.... well, you get the idea.The first few episodes were kind of dull, and to be honest, I wasn't all that impressed with the CGI.  Now, I'm notoriously unimpressed with CGI, so take that with a grain of salt. It does get better toward the end of the season.  I think it was an experiment to counteract the fact the Japanese were kicking our butts with traditional animation. Still, after a while you stop wincing at the animations and how we seem to keep staring at everyone's beast-mode butt, and eventually, the plotting picks up.Midseason, there's some downright solid writing.  "Possession" is a personal favorite, because not only is Starscream back, we get a few of the absolute best exchanges in the entire season. And the pop culture references start happening, and basically, it stops taking itself so darn seriously.There are a few continuity...things.  Stuff we see once and never again that you'd think would be important.  Giant floating island crash-landed near the Maximal base? No one tries to salvage it? Being in beast mode for too long schizes you out?  What about Tigatron?  Predacon base being blown to heck how many times now?  Where'd the tanglers from Sentinel's security net go when the Preds actually make it into the base? And why, oh why, do we need females?  Are they essential to procreation? (They sure all have great racks!) If they are needed to reproduce, do I really want to know if it's done in beast mode or not?"The Low Road" is the watershed episode in this series. Based on a fart-joke that would have made Chaucer proud, it brings a goofiness to the series which lingers on in things like Megatron brushing his dino-head's teeth, Inferno calling Megatron his 'queen', etc.It's a cartoon series made basically to shill toys, but midway along (and all through season two) it takes on a life of its own. Does it compare to G1?  Yes, and no. It's a good series with deeper characterization than G1, but it is hobbled by the creative control of Hasbro.  You have to give it a decent try: don't decide just on the first episode or two. </p>

 <p> Next Generation of Transformers </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Beast Wars Transformers was the first Transformers series that I was able to get into, mostly cause the Generation One series started when I was only 9 months old at the time.  While that this series I started watching with my brother, though I never thought I'd get into the series but after a few episodes I was hooked into the series.  I think that it's cause of the story telling that went on throughout the show that drew me into watching this show, while at the same time it blended humor into it very well.  Although the first season is 26 episodes long, giving enough time to develop the characters throughout the season as well as get in what they wanted to help bring the show to where they wanted to take it.  While at first it didn't seem like that this show would tie in to that of Generation 1, but as the season goes on there are mentions of the original Transformers show.  The CGI animation for this show was a first for the whole Transformers franchise and although it wasn't the best looking though it was able to manage for the time that it was done, think this was done in the mid-90's.  My only complaint of this set is that two of the episodes, `A Better Mousetrap' and `The Probe' are in the wrong order, although on the back of the case they're in the correct order.  Overall I give this set 4.5 stars out of 5. </p>

 <p> Finally finally finally, someone listens to our begs and pleas to bring this great series to DVD.  Rhino, I applaud you.  Obviously this is the longest collection of all three seasons, and this is the root for the much more exciting and plot twisted second & third seasons.Every episode is well crafted, wasn't bored with anyone of them.  My favorite Cybertronian of course, is Optimus Primal.  I just wish he would have used his power to its full potential like he did in "Gorilla Warfare".  Which was one of my favorites episodes from the first season.  If you loved Transformers from the past, then you gotta get this and see what their descendents have started.  Get this right away!! </p>

 <p> It's about time that this show was put on season sets instead of those volumes with only six episodes each. Anyway this series is a followup to G1 Transformers from the 1980's and takes place approximately three centuries later. I first heard of this show back in 1998 when I was fifteen, I watched one episode and was hooked. Even now that I'm almost twenty this show still holds the same effect for me as it did then. I recorded 46 out of 52 total episodes off of TV, but now that they're on DVD I can get rid of my six year old videos with their horrible sound and picture. The picture quality is fantastic, especially compared to broadcast quality, the 5.1 sound is great too, like during the battle sequences. As far as the stories go they're great with only a few exceptions. IMHO every episode is worth watching however some are marred by too much slap-stick comedy, but oh well. This season is mostly more light hearted then the second season, "Code Of Hero" would be a good example of the darker 2nd season episodes. This season establishes the beginnings of the alien story arc which culminates in the second and third seasons. There are numerous references to the 1980's transformers series starting in the first episode, one G1 character makes an actual appearance in the episode "Possession". There isn't much in the way of special features there are two interviews with Larry DiTillo and Bob Forward. But I could care less. Having this great series on DVD brings back all those great memories. Definately worth buying. I look forward to the second and third seasons coming out as well as Beast Machines. </p>

 <p> When Beast Wars first came out, I was in middle school and at the wonderful age where I had judged myself too old for such things as "Beast Wars" and "Transformers."  So I missed out on perhaps one of the best science fiction shows of the 90s.About the 11th grade, I determined I didn't give a rip if anybody cared if I still liked Transformers, but by that time, Beast Wars was gone, and had been replaced with the questionable Beast Machines.  I read up on the Beast Wars, though, intrigued by what I had missed.So when Rhino released the first season, I bought it as soon as I could find a copy.  I was not disappointed.The episodes are all well-made, and the story writing is also well done (except for the episode "The Low Road;" ugh.)  My personal favorite episode is "Possession" which features the return of original Transformers character, Starscream!  Another top-notch episode is "Law of the Jungle," which has a surprisingly mature look at death, sacrifice, duty, and honor.Basically, everybody in the family can enjoy "Beast Wars"--there's enough technobabble for hardcore Sci-fi fans, humor for the kids, and plenty of action and adventure throughout. </p>

 <p> I have been on the fence about this show for quite sometime. I remember my son watching it and being amazed by; first the CG work and second by the strong characters. But who wants to take a $5?.?? plunge? Well, I dove......Well, the CG work for Season One, at least the first 7 eps. seems fairly dated and yet STILL has some particularly beautiful moments. The bot transformation are still a marvel to see and yeah, the backdrops are often sparse, and yet I still BELIEVE they exist for the sake of the characters, which for me is a must. There is something about this series that really makes me feel as though I am watching 'true pioneering' through the CG work. Like everything I'm seeing was made from a labor of love and is truly unique.So many clever plot points injected right from the beginning: Dinobot 'the traitor' being a Maximal always has an edge to his presence; the orbiting stasis pods with the remaining crew orbiting the planet that can 'drop in' at any time; the fact they have to remain in beast mode but CAN change into robot form for short bursts is just pure genius.The voice acting and character development on the first 7 episodes is actually beyond what I hoped. Easily taking up the slack for some of the dated visuals...This for me, so far is a slam dunk purchase and the characters have that sort of instant chemistry that isn't forced. Some of the Predicons are annoying but alls fair in love and Beast Wars, eh??I bought Season Two also but kept it wrapped up just in case this one wasn't worth beans, but it looks like I'm keeping both and making a mighty fine Burrito:), b/c the general word is that the 1st season is the worst season...!! Can't wait to see Season Two!! </p>

 <p> When this came out in the mid-90s, I was suprised to catch it on one of the local channels early sunday mornings.  Transformers were back, and at the time in really cool computer graphics.  The Maximals, decendents of the ancient autobots, and the Predicons, decendents of the ancient decepticons, battle it out on a remote planet (found later to be earth). It is a fun story line watching the first season as they adapt to this new world.  episodes 1-2 are tied together, then the other episodes are just kinda loose, no major storyline carried over episode to episode. As the season nears the end, and into the 2 and 3rd seasons, the stories get placed more into a continueing theme storyline. Looking at the computer animation now, it was kind of crude, even compared to the Beast machines episodes, but it was good at the time. So if you like the original transformers, I think you will addapt well to this cartoon series.  Check it out, still affordable here on amazon and easy to get a entire series cheap. </p>

 <p> Amazing!  Just amazing!  After all these years I'm still impressed by Beast Wars.  The dialog is unprecedentedly well-written for any children's show.  A collector's item for any true Transformers fan and guaranteed fun for the whole family. </p>
