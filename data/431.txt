 <p> I thought this book was clever as it brings simple cost effective ideas to the reader.  All of the ideas are simple and quite do-able.  I love the simple recipes and can't wait to try the mushroom chicken recipe. </p>

 <p> If you are looking for a book that has inexpensive ideas for the entire family then you are going to love this book. There are lots of cute ideas and some very clever ones, like how to easily decorate a cake. I also liked the tips on how to keep flowers fresh. That tip alone is worth the price of the book. If you have kids then there are plenty of ideas on how to make your kids feel special. I also liked the ideas about the treasure hunt. There is also a good idea in this book about what to give a teacher for Valentine's Day. The recipes also sound delicious. I'm looking forward to trying some of the recipes in the near future. I also thought this book had some very funny moments. This book proves that you don't have to be rich to make Valentine's Day fun for everyone. All the ideas seemed very inexpensive.~The Rebecca Review </p>

 <p> I enjoyed reading through this book. It has a lot of nice, "G-rated" ideas in it and quite a few recipes in it. If they mentioned a recipe, they included it. The ideas and recipes were low-cost. The recipes included were able to feed a family or just the two of you - your choice. There were also ideas for kids - both for them personally and things they could make/do for family and/or friends.I didn't see any grammatical or spelling errors, though I read fast and sometimes a spelling error will get past me. I downloaded the book for free and read it in my Kindle Cloud Reader.When I got to the end, I saw that there were about 33 pages left in the book and thought that it was another case of an author padding the page count. Turns out, there were 4 pages of ads for other books and their website and 2 pages of legal stuff. Don't know what happened, but I clicked each page and watched the page count jump several pages at a time. So there is some kind of formatting error or glitch at the end. And the pages of ads were actually about 1 to 3 books on each page, not page after page of them. Other than that, the only other formatting problem was that on some of the recipes, the ingredient/amount column wasn't straight. For me, it's not a problem, but some people might notice and be bothered by it. Other than these two issues, the formatting was good. No "funny" characters for missing punctuation or other problems that can make text hard to read.I will note that there are 2 Bible verses quoted towards the end of the book. They were not "proselytizing" verses but about love. I wasn't offended, but I do know that there are people out there that would be, as anything religious seems to sets some people off. </p>

 <p> I am glad I did not pay for this kindle book.  The authors were very unprofessional and even condescending at times ( for example, referring to hunting as shooting &#34; the life out if Bambi's mother.&#34; and intimating that I lazed around the house looking &#34;like something the cat dragged in&#34; instead of working at my marriage).  There were a few interesting ideas, but nothing extremely new or exciting.  It was a great idea, but the execution was just not there. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Glad it was free </p>

 <p> It gave some really good suggestions that I hadn't thought of before, and others were things that I had already considered. But she can't be a mind reader and know everything that I know. So overall, it was helpful, which was it's point. </p>

 <p> It's alright </p>

 <p> This book is a quick read, but full of great ideas. They remind you to hit the clearance isles from Christmas for the red, gold, and green Hershey Kisses (use red and gold for Valentine's day and save green for St. Patrick's day) and don't forget the bargains for Valentine's day next year that go on sale Feb 15. There are recipes as well as a poem and many ideas that cost very little. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Lots of ideas </p>
