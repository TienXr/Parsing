 <p> We purchased this TV 2 weeks ago and everything has gone as per expectations, except one or two minor items.Pros:1. Very Good Picture and black levels, though a 3 year old Pioneer Elite 50 inch 720P still beats it from 12 to 15 ft away. Need to adjust the picture some, to get the best out of it. The BD player does an excellent job of upconverting the less than 1080p inputs.2. The wall mounting and thinness, plus appearance really is first class. The inputs are beautifully arranged. The appearance on the wall with hidden cables makes me smile everytime.3. The Samsung apps, PC share work well, however a Samsung Blue ray player BD6900 realy helps, some features are only available when the BD player is hooked up.4. The remotes between the TV and BD player are as well integrated as can be expected, give Samsung full marks for this one.I am afraid to think (or find out) if this all would not be the same with a BD6800 or lower/older model, did not want to find out so sprung the extra for the BD6900. The BD player is also really fast loading up, a big plus. Use a High speed ethernet HDMI cable and hooked up through ethernet, more on that later.5. Works well with the Sanus 1100 thin wall mount (under $100), can tilt up the TV and access the rear very easily. Wasn't about to spring for the super expensive Samsung wall mount rip-off, its just a glorified picture hanger for $250 !!Cons:1. The dedicated wireless had trouble hooking up, and I hear that streaming video on wireless is still not ready for prime time. I luckily had ethernet access which I utilized and it was the best thing I did. Still have not tried out streaming video, but Youtube with its low bandwidth works fine (though the picture is like a VHS tape quality)2. TV runs hot, hotter than some other plasmas. I guess I won't be cold this winter since it is in the bedroom. I hear all plasmas run hot, and that this is nothing to worry about when it comes to longetivity of the display or anything.3. Sound quality is OK, about 1/2 of what a stereo/amp dedicated speakers would produce.Note:I used a line conditioner (Belkin, under $100) that also protects against Voltage spikes and such, plus the ferrite magnet at one end of the power cable. Guess what, NO buzz at all, and the picture is crisp with deep colors and blacks.I am also afraid to run it with older Amps and Stereos, even with HDMI for compatibility issues, sound and picture quality degradation. Luckily, in the Bedroom, I don't need to and the wife prefers the cleaner look without speaker cables and stereo lights at night.I am surprised at all the issues with incompatibility that I read about with proprietary BS that is getting into these 3D TV's and BD players. Why can't they make good stereo boxes with all their electronic trickery instead and make plain TV monitors and BD players at half the cost. That way, compatibility will not be an issue. I guess its a marketing decision again!So far, I took the path of least resistance and kept it simple. It seems to have paid off for me and I love the set-up. </p>

 <p> I purchased this tv from amazon in september. I was already doing 3d through the Nvidia 3d vision kit but needed a bigger screen. This tv for all practical purposes is great. But I bought it mainly for its 3d capability and that so far has been disappointing. To the point, I am now considering returning this tv and get a Panasonic VT series.Pros:Thin, lightweightexcellent picture qualitymenus easy to navigateinternet appsCons:glasses lose sync in bright 3d scenes and fast movementsignificant crosstalk in many bluray 3d moviesvery bad image retention that has not improved even after breakin.3d mode does not kick in all the time and sometimes the tv has to be turned on and off.pc connectivity is iffy, resolution defaults to 1600 x 1200 causing a squished image. display goes off randomly.Other thoughts: People say you can change it to an 8000 series in the service menu. I did it and its just a gimmick. There was really no improvement in the tv itself. </p>

 <p> This TV is really amazing. The color depth picture quality is so great. The only missing feature is browsing the internet and that too I overcame by hooking my Wii system to my TV. Now my samsung C7000 is nothing less than a internet TV. U can get this TV for around $1100 and for the whole system including BD6800 and the starter kit and with a extra pair of rechargable glasses for around $1600. That is what I paid for my set when i purchased mine around 1st week of November. </p>

 <p> I purchased this TV along with the 3D Blu-ray player and the 3D glasses (Amazon Special Deal) at a great price. The 3D effects can be used at any time (even on regular TV) and are amazing. I actually flinched while watching Monsters vs. Aliens! The Internet apps are great but creating accounts can be a bit of a pain while trying to use the remote as a keyboard. It would be much easier to use the apps if a wireless keyboard were available (one woud think that would happen considering how more and more TVs are internet capable-anyone remember WebTV?) I consider this package a great deal from Amazon. The TV has a wonderful picture and the 3D Blu-ray player and 3D glasses have worked flawlessly so far. I agree that the TV speakers aren't the best. I have my audio optical out connected to a separate sound system and it sounds great. </p>

 <p> I purchased this TV in the fall of 2010.  The picure quality if beautiful and I have no trouble connecting to my wireless router and watching and streaming internet tv.  The problem I'm having with the TV is that it switches itself to Store Demo mode on its own for no reason.  Also comes out of HDMI mode and goes to TV mode on its own too.  I have Dish Network so when it does that of course the picture disappears until I switch it back to HDMI.  Now, the real problem is that sometimes when it switches itself to TV mode and I try to switch it back the remote won't work.  Nor does the Dish Remote, so I have to unplug the TV and wait quite awhile before either will work again.  What's up with all of this?  I upgraded the firmware and reset the TV several times to no avail.  Any help would be appreciated.  Purchased at Sears for a great price.  I love this TV when it works, but the problems keep me from buying another Samsung. </p>

 <p> I've been very impressed with the Samsung TV's for a number of years - they have very impressive image quality, holding fine detail down into the black areas of the picture. I bought this model to replace a 42" Samsung "HD Ready" 1080i unit, which was only about 5 years old (and still has a very good image quality - but I wanted to upgrade to 1080P).  After a bit of research and many comparisons, I came to the conclusion that (a)Plasma is still better than LED and (b)Samsung still has the best overall picture quality.I was ready to purchase the lower end model - the PN50C550 - which really has all the features I need and is quite a bit less expensive, but I was able to get a bundled deal on the PN50C7000 along with a Samsung 3D Blu-Ray player and FOUR of the 3D glasses for a good price at Best Buy (most of the other packages I had seen only came with two sets of glasses, and were still more expensive!).  It will be a while till there is a decent selection of 3D movies, but it's a "nice to have" feature in the meantime.Overall I am exceedingly happy with my purchase, with a few caveats:- Upgrade the firmware immediately. The newer firmware version fixes quite a few problems, specifically with correctly setting the color space and resolution when playing a standard def DVD from a Blu-Ray player (and it also improves the 3D performance, minimizing the "ghosting" that many people have complained about)- The sound quality from the internal speakers is poor. I think it's the best they could do with a TV that is this thin, so the designers were constrained by the physical dimensions which prohibit proper speakers.  Get yourself an external amplifier and some decent speakers (I recommend the Denon AVR591 and the Definitive Audio ProCinema-600 speakers)- There is no S-Video input (another reason to get an external amplifier - just make sure you get one that has analog in and upsamples to 1080P HDMI out)You can't go wrong with the Samsung PNxxC7000 series (at whatever size you desire) - and if you want to save some money and don't need the 3D, the PNxxC550 series will probably suit your needs just fine. </p>

 <p> I have been researching plasma televisions for the last few months in preparation for my first large TV purchase.  It was a painstaking process that eventually lead me to purchase the Panasonic G25.  Because I lived with that TV for about three weeks and have enjoyed the C7000 for the same amount of time, I am poised to compare the two.What first must be addressed is why I chose to return the G25.  Two words: floating blacks.  This is not to be confused with the phenomenon of rising blacks, where over time the ability of the panel to produce deep, dark blacks is diminished (although this afflicts 2010 models, it occurs at a more gradual rate).  "Floating blacks" occurs when images on screen change in brightness and the blacks rise and fall as a result.  This represents a significant problem because it is reactionary: when a bright image appears, the blacks do not rise immediately so the effect becomes very obvious and irritating.  Floating blacks have been reported by many, while others swear they either do not exist or are indiscernible.  I found the behavior to be pervasive for all material and absolutely unbearable.  This is unfortunate, because the G25 was fantastic in every other regard: nearly perfect colors out of the box in THX mode, rich blacks with great shadow detail and not a hint of image retention or burn in.  In all of the aforementioned categories, the G25 outperformed the C7000 and makes me wish Panasonic would have their niggles sorted.Onward to the C7000.Overall, I am very pleased with the television.  Aesthetically, it is an extremely striking piece of kit.  The base is a beautiful piece of brushed aluminum (well, it's probably steel, but the finish is brushed), the bezel also sports a brushed finish, which in my opinion is far superior to the glossy bezel of most sets, and the glass-like base support and surround add the finishing touch to a special looking television.The picture quality of this television is great, to be sure.  I find the out-of-the-box colors to be fairly inaccurate and they will be further from true without a professional calibration than the Panasonic.  Black levels are good, although not as a rich as the G25 (pre-rise anyway, that could change after a year or two).  The screen is a bit brighter than the G25 with more color pop and I have had no issues with motion.  The G25 was noticeably grainier, a possible issue if one's normal viewing distance is closer than average (say, closer than 8 feet).  The standard menu allows for far more customization than the Panasonic and there is no need for a non-professional to ever enter the service menu.  The internet widgets are exponentially superior to those offered by Panasonic, but I have so many streamers, media devices etc. that the included Samsung apps are rarely used.There are a couple of things that irk me with the Samsung, none necessarily significant.  Image retention is far more prominent on this set than the Panasonic or my parents' five-year-old Phillips.  A static image left on screen for just a few minutes will result in image retention (and I do have the pixel orbiter set to engage after just one minute).  Luckily, it will disappear within minutes after switching to any content that will get those pixels moving and none of the retention has resulted in burn-in.  I do play games and still detect no burn-in whatsoever.  Also, I did notice a bit of line bleed that I never experienced with the G25, but that seemed to be an isolated incident as I have not observed it again.That segues nicely to my next point of complaint: game mode.  The input lag on this set makes games unplayable in any mode BUT game mode.  This in itself is not an issue, because with game mode engaged, any remaining lag is imperceptible.  The problem stems from a poorly designed menu.  To activate game mode, you must enter the menu, scroll down to services, then click the general setting menu, and then choose on or off.  If input lag is going to suck so much in all other modes, this needs to be a single button-click on the remote.  Moreover, you can't disengage game mode by simply switching picture modes.  Instead, you must again navigate the same asinine menu tree.  Irritating and unnecessary, but at least input lag is perfectly acceptable once in game mode.What many buyers considering this set are probably concerned with is 3D capability.  It is by far the least expensive 3D television currently available and (especially with the present inclusion of a BR player/starter kit combo) is an unbeatable value.  3D on this set is nearly as good as the big boys (read: VT25) with little crosstalk or ghosting.  3D content is sparse at the moment and will continue to be for the foreseeable future (partly because of the exclusive packaging bull malarkey perpetuated by Samsung and the studios themselves; talk about shooting yourself in the foot).  As such, the 2D-3D conversion algorithm is a nice addition and can deliver surprisingly impressive results.  It works well for some content and is insufferable with others, so you will have to experiment and see what works for you.  Some games and animated content seem to respond particularly well.  I recently experimented with native 3D content via the PS3 and was surprised with the results.  Stardust HD and Motorstorm both exceeded my expectations, especially considering they were not initially created with 3D as an objective.  WipeOut, while not nearly as striking (and a medicore game at best), still enjoyed the added benefit of depth afforded by 3D and still yields an appreciable effect.  I should also add that I have experienced no issues whatsoever concerning communication or syncing between the glasses and the television.  Additionally, the glasses are fairly comfortable and having to change a battery every 50 hours is actually preferable in the long run, as opposed to losing the charge with internal units, necessitating a trip to the factory (or refuse bin).A tangential but important note: when the 7000 line of Samsung plasmas was first released, a picture-processing mode called Motion Judder Canceller was engaged and undefeatable.  What this processing actually does is irrelevant: it should be avoided like the plague.  If you choose this set, make sure it has firmware 1026 or later installed or download it immediately if not.  For giggles, I converted my C7000 into a C8000 in the service menu, which activates the option to enable or disable MJC (I do not recommend this as there is no need).  I enabled it and within seconds wanted to gouge my eyes out, it really is that bad.  Make sure MJC is off, forever.  And ever.I suppose this review might come across as somewhat negative.  I have decided to keep the Samsung and am happy to have returned the Panasonic, if that is any indication.  I give a slight edge to the G25 in overall picture quality, so if you do not need/want 3D and do not observe floating blacks - or don't know what the heck I'm talking about (and believe me, ignorance is most definitely bliss here) - I would go for the Panasonic, primarily because it is surprisingly inexpensive for the picture it offers.  Otherwise, the Samsung is a great set and impeccable value considering its feature set and stunning design.  All of the 2010 plasma models have their foibles, it just so happens the C7000 offered the least of them in areas concerning me for the right price. </p>

 <p> I finally took the plunged to replaced my old HD RPT 47" Panny, I decided on the Samsung 3D plasma.  The free 3d starter kit and 3D blu ray player really makes this deal a no brainer.  The picture quality is fantastic.  Planet Earth was an amazing thing to watch.  I did have a problem with 1080p 24 Hz mode from PS3 but it was the HDMI cable. Strange, the cable worked fine with the Panasonic.  Right now, plasma TVs are the way to go -  cheaper price and better performance.  Anyone interested in my old Panny?  I'm thinking of getting another plasma for bedroom. </p>

 <p> Bought the item and after 2 weeks returned it.* Annoying buzz sound can be heard from the TV* Same old Plasma TVs Ghost picture problem* Because of the slim design it's very hard to connect the cables on the back specially if you're using coax cables.* 3D is really cool, but it's nothing like you see in a 3D,4D Theme parks where stuff really look they're floating in front of your eyes. It has 3D depth mostly.* If I'm paying 2K I want something really outstanding and I should say this wasn't. </p>

SAMSUNG RELEASED ON 09/02/2010 A FIRMWARE UPDATE THAT WILL GET RID OF THAT PROBLEM AND DISABLE THE SOAP OPERA EFFECT THE TV WAS HAVING .NOW I ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE THAT MEGA SMOOTH OPTION AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO TURN IT BACK ON UNTIL NOW. AFTER HOURS SEARCHING I WAS ABLE TO UPDATE MY SERVICE MENU TO THE NEW 8000 SERIES WHICH GIVES YOU THE OPTION OF DOING THIS CALIBRATION. IF YOU WANT TO SPENT AN ADDITIONAL $400 FOR THIS MENU OPTION BE MY GUEST OR YOU CAN BUY THIS TV FOR MUCH LESS AND APPLY THE 8000 SERIES CALIBRATION OPTION BY FOLLOWING THIS SIMPLE STEPS.Instructions:- Turn off tv- Press Mute-1-8-2-Power in sequence- Once the tv is on, the service menu should appear at the top left corner.- Go to options- Change the model to c8000- Press reset to factory default to exit out of the menu.- Tv will turn off and back on, once is back on, a massage should appear saying, board has been change, don't worry, just click ok and everything should be fine.- To get rid of the message, just go back into the service menu and change the front color to T-C-BlackYou will notice that now under picture options- film mode- you will have a cinema smooth optionAlso you will have a motion judder canceler option.And last you will have two new presets, cal-day and cal-nightHOPE THIS HELPS YOU OUT . I WAS AMAZED WITH THIS NEW MENU OPTION AND I CANT REALLY COMPLAIN ABOUT MY PURCHASE . </p>

 <p> I brought this brand new samsung 3D TV exactly one month ago. Now I have a dead pixel line on the middle of the screen. I am very disappointed even though it is cover by warranty. I will never buy another samsung electronic again. Make sure you buy the extended warranty, you will need it. </p>

 <p> After months of reading both pro and consumer reviews I chose the PN50C7000!  It has been very easy to use, and the picture is wonderful!The sound is OK, but It will be hooked up to my HT system shortly.I hear NO buzz whatsoever, that seemed to be a complaint for some people!We watched The Blindside and Despicable Me on Bluray and it was excellent!  The skin tones (Blindside) were right on!  I used the calibration settings from [...]).The calibration settings say to set the picture mode to  "CAL-DAY", which exists for the 8000 series, not for 7000.  There is a way to switch to the 8000 menu, but I read that is risky and could cause problems.  So, I switched my picture mode to "Movie" and then proceeded with the rest of the settings.The menu took a little getting use to, but I expected that.I will NEVER use 3D, I think it is a totally useless!!  I wish the industry would put all the 3D effort into higher resolution technology instead.  In a few years consumers will be complaining about eye strain issues...especially the youth.Anyway, I would recommend this TV for sure, if you really care about getting the best/most for your money! </p>

 <p> This is my first plasma tv, but I have had a 720p Jvc for the last several years. This Samsung tv's picture is so clear and crisp compared to the the JVC.I know this is like comparing apples to oranges, this is not what swayed me on purchasing this Samsung.I went to several local stores looking at plasmas and led 3d tvs and was always more impressed with plasmas, this pn50c7000 was by far the best of the plasma tv's I was looking at(LEG,PANASONIC & SAMSUNG).Since I have had this tv in operation, 5-6 hours a night and 8-10 hours on the weekend for 4+ weeks, I have yet to see any burn in or any of the other issues others have spoke of.Only one thing I am not happy with, I am not sure if it is a Samsung problem but here it is; When watching netflix movies the screen goes black for a second, multiple times with some but not all movies.I have DSL and my router has multiple devices connected both wirelessly and wired ( this tv is wired) but this happens even when everything else is off or disconnected.The firmware has been updated but it did not make a difference to this issue.Otherwise the picture quality from digital sources and even standard cable is stunning. I am very happy with this purchase. </p>

 <p> This TV is absolutely amazing. The picture quality is top notch, and after demoing several models from panasonic, samsung and LG, I decided for the price this TV included everything I could ever want. I'm extremely pleased with my decision.After purchasing a Samsung LED in December, I was left somewhat unimpressed. My first HDTV was plasma and after owning a few LCDs and one LED I decided to go back to plasma. I mostly compared Panasonic and Samsung, but also took a brief look at some of LG's LED TVs. It finally came down to the G25 by Panasonic and this TV, the PN50c7000. Picture quality was the most important to me, so that came first. Both TV's looked excellent in HD(Source was star trek BD), but after demoing the two several times I felt the PN50c7000 had the edge. I consulted one of my buddies who is an expert on HDTVs(a professional calibrator)and he broke down the pros and cons of each model. I went with the PN50c7000 and could not be happier. The picture quality is fantastic, with rich colors and very deep blacks. The addition of 3D was also a plus to me, but definitely not one of my priorities. Standard definition also looks amazing, and with TV's these days SD quality can vary drastically from set to set(The G25 was not as great at reproducing SD, one of the deal breakers for me). Finally, the PNc7000 had far more internet capabilities than the G25, which was another added bonus, as well as 3D. Since owning the TV I have tested many sources and it seems to reproduce colors very accurately, and again, has a great contrast.I would also like to address the issue many have had with this TV, the so called "soap opera effect". The first generation models of this TV came preloaded with MJC(the newer ones do not), or motion judder canceller, which made movement look "fake" or ghostly when watching from some sources. This is a feature also found of the C8000 series, but for some reason samsung didn't include an option to turn it off on the C7000. Many returned their sets in anger because of this, but its actually a very easy fix. There are several options, the easiest being the game mode option. Switching the game mode from on to off in the general settings will turn this effect off. Do this for each source and no more MJC. Samsung has also issued a firmware update on their website which can be applied via a USB flash drive that will also fix the issue. The last option, which many tech savvy individuals have done, is switch the TV from a c7000 model to an 8000 model via the service menu, which gives you a menu option to turn MJC off. I can confirm that this works, but do so at your own risk. You can potentially brick your TV if you do something wrong. The first two options are extremely easy and safe to perform. Don't return your sets because of this and miss out on a seriously impressive TV.Overall this TV has it all. An extremely impressive PQ, internet capability and 3D are all present on the PNc7000, with a sleek, slim design to top it off. I would recommend this TV to anyone, and while the Panasonic G25 is also a very impressive TV, my opinion leans toward Samsung this year.Update: There is some image retention on this model that many will notice, including myself. Don't worry, its never permanent. There is a recommended 100 hour break in time with most plasmas, and this is no exception. If the temporary image retention bothers you, make sure you dial down the contrast and especially brightness. Do this for the first 50-100 hours and image retention should slowly become a non issue. For those who don't want to do this, run the scrolling bar across your screen when image retention occurs and it will do the trick. Note: I recently left my screen on pause for 3 hours(forgot to turn it off!) and of course it left quite a bit of burn in. I ran the scrolling bar for 2 minutes and everything went away. Works like a charm.Update #2 : Well, after about eleven months of use(and eleven great months at that) a line of pixels has died in my screen. It is a very small line about 1/3 the way down. I opened the TV up to check all the connections and they were solid, so I have chalked this up as a bad panel. Luckily I bought an extended warranty so BB has ordered the new panel and will send someone to put it in at the end of this week. I'm almost positive Samsung also offers a warranty for at least the first year, but dealing with them will probably be complex and take a much longer amount of time.I briefly searched to see if anyone else has had this issue as well but so far I have found only a few cases. While It is certainly disappointing to have a panel fail after only eleven months, the PNC7000 is still an amazing TV with stunning PQ. I would give it 4 stars, current conditions withstanding. Just thought I would share my experiences even if it is a rare occurrence. </p>

 <p> Great TV!!! We saw a 8000 model in BestBuy and were looking to buy that. I did some research and in the end settled with this 7000 model. I feel the picture is just the same and also I saved $400 by going with this.We checked out the Sony also, but feel that the Samsung had a superior picture. The picture is absolutely amazing, both with BluRay and also HD TV stations. The picture is extremely clear and adds depth to the picture. Once you put the glasses on it adds a fun 3d experience. Although currently there are limited 3d movies titles available. I believe a lot more will be released later in 2011. Also be aware that the glasses are currently $150 each!We got a great deal. Along with the TV we received a free 3d BluRay player and Shrek starter kit (x2 glasses and Shrek 1, 2, 3 and 4).Be aware that this 50" is plasma, whereas the other sizes are LCD. Plasma actually offers a slightly better picture quality to LCD with deeper blacks; but it is not good for video games. You could experience the image being burnt in with excessive playing. If you want to play video games on this TV, I would recommend one of the other sizes which is LCD.As with most TV's the speakers on the TV are not up to par. I would recommend that you add some kind of sound system. I went with a Pioneer 920 receiver, with BIC America DV62si speakers with a BIC America center speaker and F12 subwoofer. All can be had on Amazon for about $700 with free shipping. The sound is amazing and matches the picture. It really gives you the full "theater" experience.I also recommend the square trade extended warranty. It is pretty reasonably priced and protects your purchase. I find modern day electronics don't last that long and it is a nice piece of mind to have the warranty. </p>

 <p> It's 3 1/2 years old now and I've never had a hint of trouble with it. The color is fabulous, the HD is super. Hats off, Samsung. </p>

 <p> First, I'll say I'm very satisfied with the TV. Crystal clear HD and very good processing of non-HD signals. Blacks are awesome.  If I had it to do over again, I would purchase the same c7000 model instead of the c8000.However, there are noteworthy items for those shopping:Wireless Internet -For easy-setup wireless Internet use, it requires a separately purchased USB adapter device with the correct plug type. Conveniently, Samsung makes one that you can buy for $50 - $70. In my opinion, Samsung should have put in an internal wireless adapter. What a shame. Would have only cost about 75 cents.To connect my TV to the wireless router, instead of a USB dongle, I used a TrendNet TEW-430APB configured as an Access Point Client which is plugged into the Samsung's Ethernet jack. The TrendNet unit is about $40 and requires a little bit of networking knowledge to configure. This solution might be preferable if you think you will need additional Ethernet connections in the same area as the TV. Additional connections can be made available with the purchase of an Ethernet switch.Image Retention -I expected a little of this.  If you pause an image and leave it for a while, it WILL burn in but only temporarily. There is a scrolling-bar feature that exercises the pixels and removes the image. It will also go away on its own.  Supposedly severe image retention stops happening as the display panel "cures".Blurring around the edges -This was a big disappointment for me initially but it has been fixed with sets that have firmware version 1026 and later. Older sets can be updated by doing a firmware update that is described in the downloads/support section of the c7000 page at Samsung's website.This effect is called Motion Judder Cancellation (MJC) and it was very noticeable on images being panned in front of a moving background. If you have the effect (it looks like a watery halo around an object's edge) on your TV, it can be fixed by doing the simple firmware update. You will need a computer with Internet access and a USB thumb drive. In lieu of the firmware update, it can be turned off by turning ON Game Mode and then turning Game Mode OFF while using the particular affected input.I did not buy this set for its 3D capabilities so I cannot comment on that.  3D theater movies are novel but I find even the theater's lightweight glasses cumbersome.  Battery-powered home sets are no doubt heavier.  I wore glasses for the first 35 years of my life - post-LASIK, I'm not going to wear them to watch TV. </p>

 <p> After using the TV for more than 5 months, here is my thoughts on it.Pro:1) Excellent pictures, colors and clarity;2) Media player;Cons:1) Scary ghost image on screen after watching a wide screen dvd movie, which took a long time to clear up. Samsung suggest that you should not watch movies that are not full screen more than 20% of the time. This plasma TV is not for you if you watch a lot of DVD movies;2) Sound quality is poor;3) Media player does not support Chinese subtitle properly. </p>

 <p> Bought this TV since it has the 3D BD player and 3D kit. The thin style is a wow, and picture quality is good and nature to me. But there is a constant buzzing noise, especially in bright scenes even in movie mode.There is also some obvious image retention, for example, after selecting a instant move from netflix, the movie icon is still "visible".This is a good looking TV, but the buzzing noise is the deal breaker for me as I usually watch TV late at nights. Have to return it to Amazon. Time to search for the next TV again.Amazon's free TV return shipping is very good in this situation. </p>
