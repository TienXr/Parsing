 <p> This adaptation of a Japanese film was completely not what I expected - it's more a psychological thriller, a different, more intelligent take on the Freaky Friday motif. It brings up many moral and  ethical issues that might arise with psychological disorders and traumas. Olivia Thirlby is brilliant and extremely effective in her first role in this film. David Duchovny has a few great moments and in the beginning of the film looks so young, it makes one reminisce the first years of The X-Files. Additionally, the soundtrack is very appropriate and very melodic. </p>

 <p> If I could I would give this movie half a star. What an awkward movie! I had no idea when I rented this from work(blockbuster) that it was going to be that awful. A lot of people before the movie came out were asking about it, so i decided to see it to see what the hype was about. I felt the acting was terrible, Sam the 16 year old daughter that the mother's spirit goes into plays a poor part as an adult.  Frankly its just too weird seeing the daughter come on to her own dad.Although its not really her, its the mother. I turned this movie off aftering watching half of it. I didnt deem it worthy enough to watch the rest. This movie does not rent well at Blockbuster, at least the one I work at. There are far better movies out right now that you can spend $4.88 on. Please do not waste your time as I have. </p>

 <p> I thought this was going to be a spooky horror type film, but it was completely different. I've seen transference films before like Freaky Friday, etc., but this is the only one I have seen that is truly dramatic. An overbearing suburban mother gets a chance to understand her daughter and see who she really is in the most personal way before it is absolutely too late - a repeated premise, but this one takes the cake for me.And, this may sound kind of perverted or gross, but I thought all the sexual tension and innuendos that came across between David Duchovny and Olivia Thirlby, the actress who played his daughter/spiritual wife, were kind of hot. This movie almost crosses that line, but it doesn't go there which I was totally afraid of in one particular intimate scene.Olivia Thirlby reeled me in with her dual role in this movie, and I look forward to seeing her in more films in the future. David Duchovny was delicious as usual. I don't know what it is, but I just love to watch that man. </p>

 <p> In THE SECRET, Ben (David Duchovny) and Hannah (Lili Taylor) are having problems w/ their teenage daughter, Sam (Olivia Thirlby). Things seem to be getting worse until Hannah and Sam are involved in a terrible automobile accident, which leaves them both clinging to life. Ben watches helplessly while his wife dies. Back home from the hospital, Ben is confronted w/ the distinct possibility that Hannah has somehow transferred her soul / consciousness into Sam's body! This film does a good job of exploring some of the crazy, somewhat unsettling aspects of such a situation. Thirlby is excellent as the mum / daughter, making it genuinely tragic, yet fascinating. I haven't seen the Japanese original, but now I will... </p>

 <p> THE SECRET is a bit weird and disturbing. David Duchovny's wife and daughter, essentially estranged from each other, are in a horrific car crash. The daughter dies. The distraught wife dies at the same moment crying her daughter's name. Mysteriously, the daughter recovers, only she's no longer Duchovny's daughter, she's Duchovny's wife in their daughter's body.So far so weird. But THE SECRET, a bizarre take on FREAKY FRIDAY, gets a little disturbing as the Mrs. settles into her daughter's life, discovering (or rediscovering) the joys of being sixteen, including sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. She also sleeps with (but doesn't seduce) Duchovny, but the intimate adult-to-adult conversations between husband/father and wife/daughter are enough to make your skin crawl, since the line, though never crossed, is toed very tightly.There is a denoument, but to tell it would be to ruin the ending, and THE SECRET doesn't deserve to be ruined. It is worth watching, though the moral of the story is, unsurprisingly, a bit murky. </p>

 <p> The Secret is not some skin-a-max David Duchovony perv fest, as the cover is begging us to believe... instead a teenage girl and her mother (amazing Lily Taylor) are in a horrible car accident. During the moment of the girls death the mother transfers herself into the body of her daughter. The daughter lives. The mother dies. The mother is inside the daughter. Is the daughter there, too? That's the premise. It's more of a mother daughter drama than a spookfest. Little is spoken of ghosts, spirituality, scientifc reasoning, etc. Suspension of disbelief is key. Olivia Thirbly, who plays the embodiment of mother and daughter, is really good and fun to watch. The topic could have been taken to a creepy incestual place, and although the dynamics of daughter/ wife/ husband/ father are explored, it's managed at a safe distance. Basically? Brain candy. </p>

 <p> This isn't a bad movie although sometimes it freaks me out when father and daughter seem like they might get intimate. The movie is about a family with a teenage daughter that acts like your typical teenager. The mom and daughter had an accident, the mom's body died which then her spirt went into her daughter. It's almost like freaky Friday the movie but a more serious drama. </p>

 <p> While this movie doesn't quite cross the line (comes damn close), its hard to get past the creepiness of a Dad cuddling, and behaving in an intimate way with his daughter. The big revelation that the mom learns about her daughter is not so interesting. The daughter is nothing but a slut and druggie.Movie is just ok.  Worthy of a rental, but barely. </p>

 <p> This was a pretty good movie to say I had never heard of it before searching Amazon for D. Duchovney. I don't think I have ever seen a movie with a story quite like this. The actors made you believe the "soul swapping" was actually going on with their actions and reactions. This actress was wonderful. I believe she has been in more movies since this one. She should go far with her skills.I only gave it 4 stars because the ending just seemed kind of meh, but that's just me. </p>

 <p> I'd say when the mother was shown yelling while the daughter is passing, one might suppose that something happens to the daughter's psyche as it is in transition going one place and the mother is calling it back to another.  So, realistically something weird could happen but this movie shows that the key to understanding this "delicate" situation is to just be patient, wait, and don't have anymore traumas and everything just may straighten itself out just as it did in this movie and that I like very much about this movie.  It was realized sensibly eventually that a choice had to be made and the choice to live both personas (both presence of minds/consciousness) as a natural course and let the mind figure out how things will go...well, I liked that part.I can see why some peope had a problem with David Duchovny's performance; it was actually unnerving to me at times.  Is it realitic for a guy to be so horny when his daughter is so ill? Okay, I'll grant the script its take on this situation. Mourning comes in stages and it is very difficult for a husband who loses a wife he loves but the script should have been written to show him in mourning stages but then I grant the script what it did suppose that the husband did go into mourning for his wife once his daughter was fixed in her mind.  So okay.  I think that might have been a normal course for some guys but not for others.  Some fathers would have taken their daughter to their sister's or grandmother or aunt, some female in the family and that would have been it.  He would have entered his mourning stages even though his wife's "mind" was in his daughter's body.  But this way is a possible way to do it so that everybody ends up SLOWLY growing into the new reality to avoid more shock and trauma.  The point is: the body often heals itself, including the mind.But I did have a problem with a mom who could stop herself from using drugs like the daughter and having sex with her boyfriends but she couldn't stop her self from wanting to have sex with her daughter's father.  That was out of place with the mom we were shown.  But then, again, I guess I have to allow the script to allow everybody to get use to the new reality.  But as I think about it: I still have a problem with that aspect. because the mind of a mother can have a desire for a young fellow her daughter brings home but her mother self forces her to control her lust.  And, we were shown a mother who was shown to be in control of herself for the sake of her daughter.I agree. This was an interesting movie. A "sleeper" but in the end the idea is very intriguing and interesting.--MO </p>

 <p> The Secret is heartbreaking, emotional and beautiful. That is a near impossible balance to find in a film today. It may be a remake, but this is no slouch effort, and it stands alone. Normally I do not care for Duchovny at all, but he did a fine job here. The real credit, however, goes solely to Olivia Thirlby, who manages to portray two characters at once seamlessly. Freaky Friday may play body-switching for laughs, but The Secret gives you an idea of what really would transpire. I did not expect to like it as much as I did, and this is without a doubt a hidden gem. </p>

 <p> While channel surfing, I noticed David Duchovny from "The X-Files" and decided to watch a little of this. It was surprisingly good, especially for a movie on the Lifetime cable channel (a.k.a. "The Men Are No Damn Good Channel"). I later discovered that it's a remake of a Japanese drama.The Freudian overtones between the husband/father and wife/daughter are nicely written. Probably a "chick flick," but surprisingly good. </p>

 <p> I saw the 2007 French/American version of this film first without knowing it was a remake. I liked it, especially the performance by Olivia Thirlby, but when I discovered the 1999 Japanese version, Himitsu, which I liked even more, it highlighted for me a little of why I like Japanese films in particular, and East Asian films in general. It's a lot sweeter and more subtle. More sad too, casts a wider emotional net. As a matter of disclosure I'll point out that I am not a remake basher, on principle, at all.The basic story centers on a seventeen year old girl whose body is inhabited by her mother's soul. The two of them were in a terrible accident, and while in the hospital, just as the mother is about to die she reaches over, all ceiling of the Sistine Chapel like, and transfers her soul into the body of her daughter. The daughter keeps her body but becomes her mother in personality and memories. When she goes to school and hangs out with her friends she doesn't really know what's going on, who the people are or what her homework assignments are, because ... well, she's her mother now, for all practical purposes. It takes her a while to come to terms with what's happened and even longer to convince her father/husband.Now, to cut right to the chase in case you can't see the 400 pound gorilla in the room, once the father is convinced that his wife is living in the body of his daughter and they, well, ya know, they're all in love and stuff ... so what about sex?Things get a little creepy but I give both films high marks for how delicately the sex question is handled. I'll leave it at that and say it's not the main theme of either film, just one of many issues that come up.The English version is loud and antagonistic. It's not a horror movie (not sure how it got marketed as such) unless you consider David Duchovny spooning with a seventeen year old girl to be horror. The daughter is in rebellion mode against the mother before the accident and their relationship takes center stage--the mother discovering her daughter's world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll while the daughter comes to recognize the love that her mother has always had for her. The Japanese version is much quieter in comparison. The mother and daughter love each other very much and the antagonism angle focuses on the husband/wife relationship. The husband becomes sad and wimpy, feeling oppressed by having his wife around only as a roadblock to his moving on. The diet of sadness is served in small introspective doses, though, and changes how the film resolves. In the English version the resolution occurs between the mother and daughter. In the Japanese version it is between the husband and wife and involves a big twist that should serve to remind viewers that this has been a fantasy film, after all. As mentioned, I saw the English remake first and it didn't do the twist, and when I watched the original (with the twist) I thought to myself "This is why I like Asian cinema." It is so Japanese. Just when the limits of despair seem to have been reached, another complex layer of sadness is revealed for your weeping pleasure. (I wonder how the book they're both based upon ends.)I'm not a remake basher but I think if I had seen the Japanese version first I might have railed against the remake for changing focus and tone. Having seen the English version first allowed me to enjoy it for what it was, and it didn't in any way impinge upon my enjoyment of the original. I recommend both films but suggest, oddly, seeing the remake first. Both films explore, and handle, the creepy dilemma of "Would you have sex with your wife if she was living in your daughter's body?" quite well. They're both sweet and touching ... except for some of the touching. </p>

 <p> Overall, I found this movie surprisedly good, dramatic and even funny at times.I thought the story was very unique.  While I've seen several movies with people who switch places, or even possessions, I'd never seen one with this dramatic twist to it.The story follows a regular family, mother and father and only daughter through their drudgery of their lives.  The parents have a great relationship, but their sixteen year old daughter remains disengaged and aloof.  Enter car accident, which changes the whole scene, dramatically when the mother and daughter switch places.I thought the casting was good.  The girl (or woman) they got to play the daughter did an excellent job!  Some of the directing and visual representations of scenes I found distracting.  It was like they wanted to build up the moment, and then fell short.The major thing that bothered me, was the end.  A little too corny for my tastes.  Could have been better written and better conveyed visually. </p>

David Duchovny's acting, as usual, was awesome and he's great to look at.  Olivia Thirlby played the part of the daughter and the mother to perfection.  Lily Taylor, though not pretty, is a fair actress and did a reasonable job as the wife.  She played the blind girl in X-File episode, Mind's Eye, passably well. </p>

 <p> Duchovny is one of my favorites and that main trailer had my customers asking lots of questions so I made sure to fit in this warped little title this weekend.The story is laid out explicitly on the DVD case and in the trailer. Really all that was left to discover was how believable they made it and whether they cross any gross-out lines of keeping it "in the family". The performances were very adequate and make for a sustainable take on the body/spirit switch. The lead up to the event with their lovey-dovey marriage was over the top sap, but still fun. Through the course of the film, the young actress does a great job of fulfilling a split personality type roll, and I look forward to seeing more from her. By the end of the film you forget who is really there and who is not (in her mind).SPOILER: I will get to the obvious question as numerous people have said they will not rent it if it goes down a certain path of consumation; It does not. But that does not mean you won't feel uncomfortable at times. For what this film is, I gave it a higher rating because of the believability without going X-Files-ish in how/why it happens, plus the acting was solid.Quality of the DVD was fine, (did not get to the Blu this week) but it still showed a variety of failings with the camera grain; there were several takes of back/forth dialogue scenes that were obviously shot by different cameras where the grain detracted from the scene. The interviews and behind the scenes were nice additions for the release. </p>

 <p> "The Secret" (2007) is a family drama with a twist, about a middle-aged family man, Dr. Benjamin Marris (David Duchovny), who has recently lost his wife Hannah (Lili Taylor) in a car accident. Their only daughter Samantha (Olivia Thirlby) survives, but when Sam regains her consciousness in hospital, she claims that she is Hannah trapped in her daughter's body.At first Ben is skeptical, thinking this is only Sam's delusion, but things get unexpectedly complicated when he realized another possibility: what if Hannah, Ben's wife, is really inside Sam, his daughter? How should they (I mean, Hannah and Ben) live from now on?With more effective elaboration on the theme of social mores or taboos, "The Secret" would have been a first-rate psychological mystery/romance. Unfortunately, what we get here is an intriguing subject matter ruined by clich&eacute;d characters (including Sam's cardboard teenage friends), weak acting from the stars and heavy-handed narrative. Even those who are impressed with the film's unique set-up would think there might be a better way to explore it more effectively.Actually, there is. Co-produced by Luc Besson, "The Secret" is an English-speaking remake of "Himitsu" (meaning "secret"), 1999 Japanese film starring Ry'ko Hirosue ("Wasabi" opposite Jean Reno). Y'jir' Takita, responsible for Oscar-winning drama "Departures" (also starring Hirosue), directed the film adapted from the novel "Himitsu" by Keigo Higashino. The original movie was not as great as "Departures," but it still made a point with sly humor, pointed satire, and most importantly, a different (and astonishing) ending that has something to do with the "secret."Swiss-born director Vincent P&eacute;rez, better known for his works as an actor ("Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train" "Swept from the Sea"), has completely changed the meaning of "The Secret." Now in the remake it is about the dysfunctional relationship between a parent and a child. This is "Freaky Friday" without humor, definitely not a big secret we would be interested. (If you want to know what the "secret" really is, read the original novel, translated in English as "Naoko" published by Vertical. All I can say is that they took out the most interesting, and perhaps shocking, part of the story. What remains does not make much sense.)I tried to enjoy "The Secret" as what it is. But "The Secret" does not know what it wants to be. The film is neither good nor bad. Considering the interesting premise, this is something disappointing. </p>

 <p> "The Secret" stars David Duchovny as Ben Marris, a successful ophtalmologist who is happily married to Hannah [Lili Taylor of The Haunting]who is a housewife. They have a rebellious 16-year-old daughter Sam [Olivia Thirlby]and from the beginning we can see the antagonism Sam feels towards her over-protective mother. Both mom and daughter head out on a weekend trip and an accident causes both to be critically wounded, eventually resulting in a bizarre occurence in which Hannah's spirit transfers over to Sam's body whilst Sam's spirit lingers somewhere in limbo-land.The rest of the movie deals with how Ben comes to grips with this bizarre turn of events and how Hannah struggles to cope not only with having lost her material body, but having to try to 'find' her daughter's spirit within Sam's physical self, whislt at the same time traversing the tension-fraught life of a high school teen. Both Ben and "Hannah as Sam" also have trouble dealing with the weirdness of their situation as being deeply in love, they come to certain realisations about the impossible situation they are both in. Ben is torn between wanting to satisfy his and Hannah's emotional and sexual needs whilst not wanting to cross the boundaries presented by his own daughter's material body.The leads do a credible job of portraying three individuals trapped in an intolerable situation, though it is Duchovny's Ben and Thirlby's Sam that carry the movie for the most part. Olivia Thirlby's performance as Samantha/Hannah is commendable as she portrays both mother and teen credibly. Viewers can really tell when she is playing either mother or daughter. Thirlby is definitely a young actor of promising talent based on this performance.This is supposedly a remake of a Japanese movie titled Himitsu, and though I haven't watched the original, this movie can stand alone on its own merits. Though it has a supernatural premise, it never really delves too deeply into that aspect for the movie deals more with how individuals cope under strange circumstances. Ben and 'Hannah' do seem to accept the situation way too quickly [which did strike me as very odd], but at 1.5 hrs long, the movie really didn't have the luxury of time to go in depth into the topic of spirit transference/possession.On the whole, I found "The Secret" to be quite an engrossing drama and well carried by credible acting.SPOILER ALERTFor those viewers who are very much concerned about the taboo aspects of this movie, i.e. a dad having to deal with a daughter who has her mother's spirit residing within her and the physical issues of dealing with that, do not fret. The movie never crosses the line towards actual physical consummation nor any explicit displays of affection between Ben and "Hannah as Sam". </p>
