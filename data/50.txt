 <p> I ordered this TV with a little hesitation due to the buzzing remarks in a lot of thethe reviews. Happy to report my set doesn't make a peep. I live in IL where we're about 600 ft above sea level. I've heard higher altitudes will cause issues with buzzing on Plasma TV's.Delivery was quick and easy, ordered Monday and rec'd it on Wednesday afternoon. The picture is absolutely beautiful. you'll quickly notice how bright the colors are and how well this set handles contrast. Obviously out of the box I had to tone down the color (it was in store torch mode) but after some tweaking and calibration it's about as good as it can get. I get a great picture in the daytime.I watch Blu Rays through my PS3 as well as play games. I also use an Xbox 360, Wii and I have an Imac that I run through this TV for my Blu Ray back ups, stored on a external hd. Look through Cnet and Consumer Reports and you'll see how well they reviewed this TV. Go for it!!I will update after a month or two if anything has changed.Samsung PN58B650 58" PlasmaPS3, Xbox 360, WiiImac Intel 24" 4 TB of storage on External HD's </p>

 <p> LAST EDIT after 3 months of use:I keep coming back to this review and revising as I look at this purchase in hindsight, so I will be brief:1. I maintain my high praise for this unit, continues to deliver, and the impact of watching all kinds of content at such a high resolution, on such a big screen still has not gotten old.  Still amazing and as enjoyable as it was when I first got it.2. For those with an Xbox or PS3, or some other kind of media server (popcorn hour, WDTV etc) I think I would recommend you consider the model BELOW (560 or even 550) this one to save some money.  The internet connectivity/Widgets function pales in comparison to what you can do with any of those dedicated components, so why pay extra for them on this TV model?  The only thing is that the anti reflective coating is different on the two models (supposedly better one the 650), but I don't remember reading about anyone saying they could tell the difference.Original review:Let me preface this mini review (mini because I just got this TV a couple of days ago) by saying I spent more time researching plasma TV's online and in meat space than any normal human being should.  An embarrassing number of hours were spent poring through every single morsel of opinion about this TV compared to other similar models.Finally, finally, I decided to take a chance and order online, realizing full well that many had reported buzzing issues, or worse, a cracked or broken screen upon arrival.Happy to report that mine was delivered in great shape and the buzz that is there is not enough to bother me (and I am very sensitive about stuff like that normally).  Not only that, but the PQ was so gorgeous, I have been kind of sitting in front of it at night, just kind of staring at it and mumbling to myself like a crazy person.  Caveat:  I have only done minimal adjusting to the settings, like switching to movie mode, turning down sharpness and contrast, etc. so the picture is probably not close to what it potentially can do...which blows me away even more.PROS:  Where to start?  PQ is out of this world - colors are so natural you might be tricked into thinking you are looking at the real thing.  Black levels are fine (I do plan on tweaking this more), motion resolution is spectacular, size is PERFECT for me at 10' or so away - I think this is the perfect size to EXPERIENCE a movie rather than just "watch TV".  Hard to describe, but you will just have to see what I mean.  Price is LOWER than the comparable Panasonic unit I was considering (54V10) and larger to boot.  Love the remote, but won't be using it long as I also bought a Logitech Harmony One.  TV SWIVELS.  Most underrated feature imo, and depending on the setup of your room and your viewing habits of course.CONS:  Spendy (but not relative to what you get imo).  Potential buzzing issue - seems to be a crap shoot whether you get a "buzzer" or not. Lots of people on AVS forums reporting a loud buzzing from normal listening distances (with volume turned down).  Cinema Smooth function seems to be broken (see CNET review for details on that) and has not been fixed by Samsung yet.  Have not tried the Yahoo widgets, but word on the street is they are slow (compared to the zippier Panasonic version of the same thing - VieraCast)  Blacks could be blacker, but they are fine.Bottom line:  I could not be happier with this TV, and still am in awe at the incredible picture it's capable of.  I bought the Blu Ray disk BARAKA as many people use this as a reference BD, and it is literally breathtaking in some scenes...the size of this TV in conjunction with a pristine anamorphic transfer at 1080p...I thought I was in heaven.  I had seen this "documentary" at least 5 times before, on regular DVD, but on HDTV's (both CRT), and the detail I had been missing on my previous viewings was immediately apparent using the Samsung (some credit to the blu ray format to of course)To sum up, let me save you some time and highly highly recommend you buy this set if you are looking in this range.  Ive done all the homework for you!  :)EDITED TO ADD COMMENTS AFTER A WEEK OF USE:The hum is there, but I only ever notice it if the sound is muted and I am sitting directly in front of the TV at head level.  Since I rarely/never watch the TV with no volume, this is not a problem for me (or anyone else at my house that watches TV), but it could be for some.Noticed that the TV really raises the temp in my TV room as well after being on a while...surprised at how much it was able to affect temp!I also watched about half of BARAKA the other night, with recommended settings (MOVIE, reduced contrast and brightness, etc) and I did notice IR where the black bars on top and bottom were.  (Noticed them even 30 min after watching movie).  I ran the IR tool they have built in to the TV for just a few minutes and it got rid of it no problem at all.Picture continues to amaze me.  I am seeing shadow detail I never knew existed in familiar material.  And even if the black levels are not as good as the ex Pioneers, they are plenty good enough to give you a very good "3-D' effect when you are watching Hi def content at night or in a reduced light setting.  Stuff just pops off the screen.  Incredible. </p>

 <p> I bought this TV after reading great reviews on Amazon and at AVSForum. But I also read the reviews that say that some of the sets are defective and make a loud buzzing noise. Unfortunately, the TV I received does exactly that. All plasmas have a soft buzz, but when you can hear it sitting 10 feet away with the volume up, it's obviously a problem. Samsung could not fix the problem and suggested I return it, which I'm doing.Anyway, besides the buzz, it's an amazing and beautiful tv. In fact, it's kind of spoiled me on all other TVs. I really can't find one that matches the picture quality, features, style and price. Amazon's return policy is great and so it was worth the try to get one, and since it's defective, I can return it no problem. I'm hoping that I will have better luck with the higher-end Samsung (the 860).If it weren't for the buzzing, this TV would get 5 stars. </p>

 <p> I bought a new set PN58B650 and it started buzzing from day one....yes it is highly directional...max buzzing if head height is right about center to the screen and you are sitting about 9 feet - 11 feet......as you go further towards either side noise drops.....so if you want to watch TV at very low volume (night) you have to turn the swivel 4-5 degrees so that your viewing is off-center....as it is a plasma you will get the same PQ...volume below 20 you can hear it....PQ is just amazing...I had panny G10.... black level was great...but color saturation was very poor....then replaced with LG 55lh90....it has exceptional black levels with solid color....but pixelation....artifical 3D effect...I watch a lot of SD channels using DTH...so motion blur is too much with lcds.....after more research I decided on this model...SD channels look great too compared to lcds...Update 12/21/2009Now its about 75+ hours...buzzing is still there...but definitely manageable....some reviews mentioned buzz increase over time...but not in my set...so planning to keep it especially with exceptional PQ after 75 hours...pretty sure its going to improve as it ages..forgot to mention....dont buy this if you are considering yahoo widgets and other internet stuffs....interface is "very" slow.....so i bought a LG BD390 blu ray player for all internet streaming instead of samsung bd because LG interface is pretty fast...also i am running breakin images (check avsforum) daily when I am not watching any movies or tv shows...PQ is getting better day by day..12/24/09ghosting issue with text menus...thought I will call samsung for a service request....guess what...samsung says my SET is "FACTORY Refurbished" one and not a brand new piece!!!! you pay for a brand new piece and receive refurbished one..hmm...I never expected this from Amazon....if your set came without the samsung sticker on the panel (left hand side with features listed dlna, ultra filter bright etc..) your set may be a refurbished one (guess not sure)...called amazon and they are replacing with a new set....as always amazon customer support is great...rep told it can be due to mislabeled box...anyway I hope this time I will get a brand new piece12/30/2009received new set yesterday....again refurb item with no feature list sticker on the panel...contacted amazon and now they are saying the first set and replacement set both were brand new!!! even though samsung website says both are reconditioned and even amazon agreed earlier that the first set was refurb....hmm...amazon/samsung has another excuse? customer rep told that the information on samsung website is wrong as this is an "OLD" model...this is stupid.....any way now I have to pay for the return shipment...I have decided not to buy any big electronic items from Amazon anymore because they are not sure if they have a brand new set or refurb one....I have changed the rating from 4 star to 3 star because of bad customer support (both amazon and samsung)...still give 4 star for the picture quality...02/01/2010Amazon has refunded shipping cost...sent a long email to customer support...actually I was not expecting to get a refund after 2 months....changing rating to 4 stars....and 5 star to Amazon support...... </p>

 <p> Mine buzzes bad but only at ear level.  If you mount it so that the bottom of the panel is at or above ear level, you will hear no buzz from your viewing location.  I didn't even notice the buzz for 2 months until I stood just right.The picture quality is phenomenal.  What else can  I say? </p>

 <p> I've only had this tv a few days so I'll update later on. But so far Picture is amazing!!! I watched Ice Age 2: meltdown on Blu-ray first and was in awe at how 3D it looked.  Watched The Matrix last night on HD-DVD through the xbox and was again impressed by the detail and clarity of the picture.  I do have the contrast low right now for break in but its still plenty bright.  I tried out Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 last night and the picture was astounding.  There was some lag for me(although I go through a reciever first) until I turned on game mode which seemed to aleviate the problem. I admit I havn't played around with many of the settings yet but will update after break in.  Image retention has been none even after watching leterbox movies.  I'm a very happy customer so far and would recommend this set to anyone.UPDATE:After six days of ownership, my wife noticed a very small crack on the bottom middle of the screen.  One call to amazon and they shipped another one. This was the third tv since the first had a broken screen upon delivery.  If my wife hadn't noticed the crack I doubt I would have seen it for a couple months.  Third TV arrived yesterday.  Was flawless and crack free. However after I got home from work there was no picture and only sound.  Another call to Amazon who as always were fantastic to work with and a fourth tv enroute today. I admit to being frustrated at all this but this is the tv I want and if it takes a few to get the right one...so be it. </p>

 <p> It has been a while since I wrote my last review on Amazon so in light of my recent purchase of this PN58B650 HDTV, I think now is a good time to put another review under my belt.If you're reading this review, you're probably in the same boat I was in several weeks ago when I was shopping for a 55+" LCD/LED/Plasma HDTV.  If you're in the "should I get an LCD/LED or Plasma TV" mindset, read on.  If you're set on getting a Plasma and really care to just know more of what's so great about this specific model, skip to the next paragraph.  Yes, I was in the market for EITHER an LCD/LED or Plasma.  During the many days I spent researching differences/advantages/disadvantages of LCD/LED versus Plasma, I came across a lot of pros and cons for both platforms.  There are supporters and bashers of both and at the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference.  I'm not really going to go into the differences between the two platforms as there is a plethora of information on the Internet that goes into great details laying that down (just google 'plasma vs lcd').  Instead, I'm going to give you my reasoning for going with Plasma.  It is a known fact that LCD TVs exhibit a "blurring" of the image during fast motion.  This is why all the different manufacturers out there have 120Hz and 240Hz models -- and you pay a premium for these over the standard 60Hz LCD TVs.  However, if you get the chance, go to your nearby electronics store and take a look at these 120Hz and/or 240Hz LCD TVs with a BluRay movie playing.  (And be sure the 120Hz/240Hz is not turned off as there is a way to turn that off -- which defeats the purpose of paying a premium for the feature in the first place).  Observe how the movie doesn't have that cinematic motion-picture feel.  It looks a lot more like watching a TV show recorded with a camcorder, or commonly described as "the soap-opera" effect.  Now watch that same BluRay movie on a Plasma screen... ahhh... doesn't that look amazing!  Okay, for me, that put me into the Plasma camp.  Onto the PN58B650.Knowing that I wanted to get a plasma TV and knowing that I wanted a tv 55" or larger, my choices were limited to three manufacturers: LG, Panasonic, or Samsung (Pioneer had already exited the Plasma market by the time I was searching for a TV but still could be found in various places).  I had previously owned a 42" Panasonic Plasma TV and have read a lot of good things about the picture quality of the Samung Plasma TVs.  Anyhow, to make a long story short, after some researching, I decided on getting one made by Samsung (but if you're in the market for a Panasonic, the PN58B650 would be comparible to the higher-pricedPanasonic TC-P58V10).If a Samsung Plasma is one of the choices you're considering, you're probably comparing the various different Samsung 58" plasma models:PN58B550,PN58B560, PN58B650, PN58B850 (not available through Amazon), andPN58B860.  So many models to choose from in a 58" from one manufacturer -- it gets very confusing.  So what the heck is the difference between the different models.  As you can see, the last three numbers in the models indicate the major model differences -- Samsung distinguishes the models as 5-series, 6-series, and 8-series.  There are two each of the 5 and 8 series while there's only the PN58B650 for the 6-series.So why the PN58B650 over the others?Since we're purchasing a television, picture quality is the number one important feature/factor to consider.  The 650, 850, and 860 all produce the same picture quality with the same level of contrast (3,000,000:1) and same color reproduction technology (Wide Color Enhancer 3 -- which also gives you much more control in color calibration if you ever decide to professional color-calibrate your TV).  All three also have a built-in Media Player (more on that later) and Internet-based widget "apps" (which I don't really care for since I do all my Internet-related activities on my computer).  The difference between the PN58B650 and the 8-series is the physical thickness of the units... 2.9" vs 1.2", respectively.  The major difference between the 850 and the 860 model is that the 860 has a Crystal Full HD Engine with Cinema Smooth feature that enhances the smoothness of BluRay movies whereas the 850 does not.  Here's the kicker... the PN58B650 ALSO has that feature -- so in comparing the PN58B650 to the PN58B860, it all comes down to whether or not you can live with a 2.9" thick TV and save hundreds of dollars compared to the PN58B860 since feature-for-feature, these two are comparible.  If money is no object, go for the thinner of the two!Now many of you are probably comparing this PN58B650 to the lower-priced PN58B560 and PN58B550.  The 5-series does lack quite a bit of features I just mentioned when comparing the PN58B650 to the 8-series.  For starters, the overall picture quality won't be quite as nice on the 5 series over the 6 or 8-series.  The range of the contrast ratio on the 5-series is less (2,000,000:1) and the color reproduction is not quite as nice.  Don't get me wrong, though, the 5-series does still yield a stunning picture, nonetheless, and you definitely can't go wrong.  Next, the 5-series models also don't have a built-in Media Player.  Let me tell you why this is such a cool feature to have.  I have various movies/video/photos/music stored on an external USB hard drive, which I normally play on my computer.  Wouldn't it be nice to play those directly on your new 58" Plasma TV?  Well, that's where the built-in Samsung Media Player comes in.  Simply plug your USB drive into the USB port of the PN58B650 (or the PN58B850/PN58B860) and the TV itself will read the movie/video, audio, photo you select from your USB drive, and play it directly on the TV (yes, the TV has a built-in hardware decoder).  This is a feature the 5-series lacks.  And finally, the 5-series units do not have Network connectivity.  This may not be a feature needed by many people but again, if you had movies/video, audio, photos stored on your computer, you can simply stream it to the TV and have the TV play the media files directly off your computer's hard drive!After owning, using, and playing with all the different features of the PN58B650 for the last two weeks, I have been just amazed at the picture quality and features of this TV.  I have watched four Blu-Ray movies on it (sooo sharp and the colors are so vibrant and true to life), played a couple differentPS3games on it, and watched various TV shows.  I also plugged in a Western Digital 1TB USB hard drive directly into the TV's USB port and watched a 1080P HD movie straight from the Hard Drive.  It had no problems playing the file (the movie was 1920x1080 x264 encoded (~9000kbps video bitrate) and had a DTS soundtrack in an MKV container in case any of you were curious).Now I've read in various reviews about how various Samsung Plasma TVs emit a buzzing noise (sort of like an electrical buzzing noise coming from the tv, not the speakers) but I'm happy to report that I have not noticed a buzzing noise (even when I mute the speakers) and I've used it for quite a number of hours.I hope this review has helped you make a decision on your next big screen flat panel HDTV.  Please click the "Yes" button below if you found my review helpful. :)UPDATE (01/20/2010):  In my review, I mentioned that I was able to play 1080P (1920x1080) MKV movies.  Apparently, it seems the built-in Samsung Media Player in the Samsung TV will not allow you to fast forward or rewind MKV movies (though it will play them just fine).  If you plan to transcode any of your home movies, be sure to transcode it to an MP4 container (instead of MKV) if you want the ability to fast forward or rewind through the movie.UPDATE 2 (02/04/2010):  After owning and using this TV for a whole month, I'd like to give a quick update since long-term reviews are better than reviews from someone who hasn't owned something for that long.First, I'd like to address concerns about the whole "buzzing noise" that some people have been experiencing with their units.  I'm very pleased to report that my unit still has not exhibited any sort of buzzing noises.  I've tried sitting at various different angles from the screen (directly in front of the screen and different angles off to the left and right side of the screen) and also at various distances from the screen (as close as 4' all the way back to 15') and there was no buzzing noise.  Since the buzzing noise is supposed to come from the TV, not the speakers, I turned the speakers all the way down to 0 so I could listen for the buzzing noise.Picture quality is still amazingly clear and vivid and I still constantly express my "oooooooos" and "aaaaaahhhs" to my girlfriend (who thinks I sound like a broken record since I can't stop complimenting the TV... oh well, she's not much of a gadget person so I guess she can't appreciate it as much as I appreciate the quality).  I've watched numerous Blu-ray movies on it and a lot of cable television.  For the HD channels broadcasting HD shows... all I can say is... WOW!  I've found myself watching random shows that I didn't really even care for just because it was in HD and looked stunning on this TV.In my 01/20/2010 update, I mentioned that I wasn't able to fast-forward or rewind movies transcoded inside an MKV container.  It turns out that this is only the case when I'm trying to watch MKV-based videos stored on my computer.  I have the TV networked to my home network with my computer acting as a DLNA server to serve media files to the TV through the network.  The TV is networked wirelessly using a wireless bridge (Samsung actually makes a USB wireless network adapter that you can use if you don't want to go through the act of setting up a wireless bridge).  When I have an MKV-based video file on a USB based hard drive/flash drive, the TV's media player can fast forward and rewind through it fine.  I haven't tried plugging the TV DIRECTLY to my router as the wireless bandwidth limitation may be the culprit.After a month's usage (used almost daily and hours at a time), I can now more confidently substantiate my original review (and my purchase!).  If the PN58B650 is still a current model in a few months, I'll provide an even longer-term update then.  Or I'll provide another update should there be any negative changes in this product I feel people should be aware of. </p>

 <p> Yes the 2009 Samsung B650 provides an excellent picture, but only under certain limited conditions.Pros:1) Fantastic picture quality during daytime viewing2) brighter than 850/860 seriesCons:1) Blacks become grey at nighttime (even worse with Cinema Smooth engaged)2) hot screen - high power consumption3) large percentage of 2009 Samsungs have weird buzzing at primary seating location4) The Cinema Smooth feature raises the black levelMy advice is to wait for the 2010 Samsungs which hopefully will have corrected these issues. I'm amazed at the rave reviews that don't offer a balanced perspective which allow consumers to make an informed choice. </p>

 <p> ordered a new tv, but received a used/refurbished unit.  amazon can't explain why there are dirty water stains, dirty wiping stains, scratches near the inputs and a shoeprint on the back panel.  yes, you read that right.  a shoeprint.  also, excessive tape on the top of the box.  checked the service menu and there were already seven hours on the panel.  this tv also buzzes and emits a high frequency to the point where my wife and i can't be in the same room with it when it's on.  i have to play my onkyo at about 75db to drown out the buzz(almost reference level), which is about 10db louder than i usually set volume when watching a movie.  otherwise, i would highly recommend this tv should you get one that doesn't buzz or if retailer doesn't ship you one that has been sold before.  the picture is outstanding on this tv.  if you're deciding on a panasonic V10 or a samsung B650, you can't go wrong with either one.  anyways, because of the issues mentioned earlier in the thread, and pilot's incompetence with shipping i will not shop amazon anymore. </p>
