 <p> Interesting insight on golf from the days of Sam Snead. Would probably only recommend to die hard fans of golf books </p>

 <p> Great book once you get past the age </p>

 <p> Because its written by a golf legend with his thoughts and story I rated this a 4 star.  As for the writing itself it is maybe a 3.  Good book for those interested in the greats and history of golf. Snead spans 40 years. </p>

 <p> I owned the paperback of this one 30 years ago when I was just learning to play golf. The lessons are timeless and the anecdotes are priceless. If you like Sam Snead you'll love reading this one </p>

 <p> This book tells so many inside stories from the gambling to the life of a boy from the hills of Virginia.  Sam playing golf barefoot at Augusta and running through a series of years with the yips really delivers a true sense of what these guys back then dealt with on the tour....great life story... </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Funny, Interesting, Sam from front to back </p>

 <p> The book was not a good read, but I am a huge golf junky, so I am glad I read it.  Only if you really love golf, otherwise do not bother. </p>

 <p> Good perspective, bad writing </p>

 <p> Sam Snead was one of the greatest golfers of all time. His somewhat &#34;folksy&#34; story telling and antidotes were entertaining and made for enjoyable reading. </p>

 <p> To a golfer, a very entertaining account.. It was published in the1960's, but, really interesting about the professional golfers lifefrom the late 1930's to 1960. Some of the instruction material, givenin the book, is still valid.  Life before steel and graphite shafts. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Entertainment golf </p>

 <p> This is a highly readable and fun book to read from an acknowledged expert in the field. I really love it and uniquely for my reading habits, I may read it again as it's got good helpful tips as well as biographical information. I feel like I learned a lot about the game as well as about the author, being a famous legend of the game. </p>

 <p> There is no substitute for self belief that Snead displayed in himself despite all his bravado , really highlights how a champion overcomes doubt </p>

 <p> Snead was real and believed </p>

 <p> Sam Snead was one of a kind in many ways and his storytelling ability comes to the fore (pun intended!) in this book he probably had ghost-written for him. That notwithstanding, this book gives the reader a great sense of what Sam considered important in life and golf. A lot of the lessons hold true today which is why this has been a timeless classic. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Still a classic </p>

 <p> Great stories  with golf instruction in a great mix to keep one interested. I was much more interested in his life stories as I am way beyond help on the golf course. One has to know his complete life story to fully appreciate his athletic abilities. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Enjoyable Reading </p>
