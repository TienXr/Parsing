 <p> classic example of excessive marketing and packaging.  No name brand works just fine.  So far so good.  I used it on my Samsung Flight phone and it formatted ok, plus it's currently holding my pictures, audio, and email. </p>

 <p> Got this to go with a ROKU player.  It works and is reasonably priced.  Not much more to say.  If you have or plan to buy a Roku, you'll eventually want to add a memory card.  This one worked for me. </p>

 <p> Very inexpensive, quick shipment, secure packaging. Fits the bill perfectly for my Roku 3. I do not intend to add a lot of channels on my Roku 3, so 2 GB is perfect. </p>

 <p> They make the most durable cards.  However, if you are going to have a micro card you may as well pay a few more dollars and get some more memory - go with an 8G, at least. </p>

 <p> 'nuthin' better' for bootable USB. </p>

 <p> 2GB isn't much space these days, but for bootable USB storage there's not much better.  And for the price, it's heard to beat! </p>

 <p> It's a 'sd' card, what more can we say.  Well I guess it is great as the card took my file transfers quickly.  Great price, do recommend! </p>

 <p> Not only does this 2 GB card work perfectly in my Samsung cell... It came with an adaptor that makes it a standard SD card size which allows me to load it with photo's, music, etc, straight from my computer... Which is much faster than loading through the phone adaptor cable.  Also came with a clear plastic case to store the adaptor safely. </p>
