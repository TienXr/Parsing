 <p> I bought Candida Cure because my mother has candida, and she is always telling me that I have it. Apparently I more than likely do, I have a lot of the symptoms, the major one is that I&#8217;m allergic to everything. I am so thankful I read this. Katherine Tomlinson covered all the bases, I have started implementing the changes to my diet and I already feel a lot better. I have been breaking out much less. This is a fabulous book. A lot of research and time was put into it. Candida Cure is the best candida book out there. I recommend reading it and trying the changes to your diet. You will be amazed at the difference it makes. </p>

 <p> &#8221;Candida Cure&#8221; is an excellent book. Since I have read it and started implementing the changes to my diet, I not only have more energy, I&#8217;m not getting headaches everyday now. Candida overgrowth can attribute to the cause of many kinds of cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Even if you don&#8217;t think you have candida overgrowth, it is a great idea to read this book, because you can be helping not only yourself, but those around you as well. Katherine Tomlinson put some very thorough research into this book. I am glad that I was able to read and learn from it. It&#8217;s never too late to cure candida overgrowth. The time is now. I would suggest everyone read this book. All can benefit greatly from it. </p>

 <p> No matter how old we get, the saying,&#8221;you learn something new everyday,&#8221; is definitely the truth. Before reading &#8221;Candida Cure,&#8221; I had never heard of the term. Katherine Tomlinson, the author, explained it to its entirety. She gives plenty of useful information and even gives you resources to help you get through it. In 30 days, with the help of this book, you can boost your immune system,reverse your food tolerance, and return to your total happy and healthy self as it states on the cover. Some may be disappointed with the the things they have to take out of your diet, but in the end, I believe it is all worth it. I recommend this book to anyone that has or hasn&#8217;t heard of Candida. There is so much information we can all benefit from. </p>

 <p> Are your tired? Grouchy? Depressed? Do you suffer from unexplained cramps, headaches, or muscle pain? Would you say you are &#8220;under the weather&#8221; or &#8220;not feeling good&#8221; or just plain &#8220;having an off day?&#8221; There might be something serious going on with your body. This was my friend, Susan. Candida causes damage by causing internal inflammation. Candida is a naturally occurring yeast organism that lives in and on the human body and helps out with metabolic processes, including digestion and respiration. The growth of Candida is normally regulated by the immune system, which keeps it from growing out of control. But sometimes, due to stress, poor diet, illness or other factors, the immune system is weakened and the Candida morphs into a fungus that spreads throughout the body, resulting in a host of health problems. Getting rid of Candida requires commitment but this book lays out a four-phase &#8220;Candida Cure&#8221; that will allow you to boost your immune system, eliminate pain, reverse food intolerances and allergies, and restore your health. </p>

 <p> The information in this book struck me at first as being just a woman&#8217;s issue.  After reading through the material more completely, I see that men can also suffer from Candida which is the focus of this book.  I&#8217;ve never heard of the condition myself but from the symptoms they speak of, I think I have heard of it even though I never heard the word, if you know what I mean. Some of the symptoms that is mentioned in this book I have on a regular basis. For example, crave for sweats, mood swings and depression. The list goes on. I relate to most of them that&#8217;s there.The Reason I thought it was only a woman&#8217;s issue is because the condition is a yeast organism. I didn&#8217;t know men can suffer from forms of yeast conditions also. Reading this helped me understand this condition and what might be going on with me and a lot of my loved ones and friends that are also having these symptoms and are not familiar with this condition. I will be passing this information on to them for their knowledge as well.If you&#8217;re having problems with the systems I mention in this review I recommend that you read this book and get the education you need on this condition in order to do something about it seeing this condition can be reversed if treated and caught early enough. </p>

 <p> When I saw this book, I couldn&#8217;t help buy it. I was super curious so I just had to read it. Boy, am I glad I did. All the symptoms described in this book sound just like my wife! We have been to doctor after doctor trying to figure it out, and this all makes total sense. We are starting her on the new diet, and all the recipes included in this book, it should be super easy and super delicious! I am hoping by changing her diet, she might start feeling better, and not like crap all the time. I will update this review some time next week or so to let you know if she is feeling better. Definitely something you should read. I know it is kind of confusing, but it makes a lot of sense after you read the book. 5 stars! </p>

 <p> Katherine Tomlinson covers a lot of ground in less than 100 pages when it comes to ridding your body of unhealthy yeast, or Candida albicans, which is part of the human body&#8217;s natural flora. According to Tomlinson, because most of us eat high sugar diets, this yeast takes advantage of that and causes a multitude of problems, such as aches, pains and inflammation. By cleansing our bodies and re-adjusting our way of eating, we can put our bodies back into balance and start feeling better.The steps that Tomlinson outlines in her book are easy to follow and make sense. She doesn&#8217;t beat around the bush and is very straight-forward in her approach, which I find very refreshing. I really like that she gives you lists of foods that you should eat at each stage of the process. She even gives you a few recipes. If you are looking to rid yourself of toxic food and begin eating to improve your health, you need to get this book. </p>

 <p> Great Book to Help Jumpstart a Healthier Lifestyle! </p>
