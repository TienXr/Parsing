 <p> Quick read, seems only appropriate for a book on minimalism. Thought provoking, inspiring and practical. Love core concepts of not allowing my possessions to own me (spot on) and striving to only have that in my live that provides meaning and happiness. Recommended reading. </p>

 <p> Live More With Less by Karen Alexander is a good book about how to simplify our lives and clear out some of the needless clutter we all have. The author writes about how if we are willing to embrace a more minimalist style of living we may actually have fuller life. By eliminating clutter we then may change our mindsets and improve our lives. Some of the main topics the author talked about in the book were:&#8226; The benefits of minimalism and if it's right for you.&#8226; How to develop new habits.&#8226; How to stop procrastinating and get motivated.&#8226; Skills to help you make decisions.&#8226; Organizing and decorating tips for rooms in your house.&#8226; How to get more time to do the things you love.&#8226; Save money.&#8226; Reduce stress and get your life in balance.I want to state again I enjoyed this book and I think you will too.Thank you for reading my review. </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed how the book had not only practical organizational advice but also had the intangible benefits well highlighted. This is a great book to help clear out clutter.  I especially think those that are downsizing would benefit from this concise and informative read. </p>

 <p> Thank you Karen.  Your topic is dear to my heart & self-esteem.  The ideas presented are all common sense & likely included in many " Get Organised " books.  However, having said that, I appreciate the way you presented these ideas, especially the abundance of encouragement all thru your book.  You were right...I'm fired up to get started so I'll have to be mindful of the tendency to take on way more than I can accomplish & be mindful of taking little steps at a time.  I read your whole book  (Kindle Fire HD (2012) on a plane trip this morning.  I'll start my notebooks & start decluttering  tomorrow.  I promise MYSELF.  I CAN DO THIS! </p>

 <p> Finally and at last a true Author who can actually articulate for us just what we need to do to be successful in the war on clutter. This book was a pure joy to read because of the positive, uplifting advice and the how-to steps to get you where you want to be---clutter free! Thank you so much for thinking of this topic and taking the time to write us such a clear, easy to follow self-help book. =))I would suggest (and have already) this book to anyone, if I were asked. </p>
