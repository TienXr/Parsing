<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The author ignores the usual tools of the trade: radios, compasses, logistics... it's like a common citizen going fishing with friends </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Necessary reading if you are looking for action on every page </p>

 <p> Enjoyed reading, in fact it's almost 1:30 a.m, not my habit, just could not stop until l finish reading the least page. I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a book that. A story that encompasses  everything!!!! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Reading this book was painful at best </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The author (Roger Grubbs) needs some serious help. Reading this book was painful at best. I got about 1/4 of the way through and couldn't deal with it anymore. The dialog just didn't flow and it seemed choppy and uncomfortable to read. In a word...DELETE. </p>

 <p> The Lady SEAL </p>

 <p> I like to read books about the SEALs, and I enjoyed this one very much. The story was interesting, will she be a part of the team or won't she, but especially when the action centered in the jungle. How do you know where you are if all the landmarks look alike? How do you carry out your orders successfully when the information given to you is flawed? What is the full story about the human trafficing? Lots of action, good characters, and engaging story. I recommend this book. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> I love seal books, but this one almost did not get finished </p>

 <p> I can't really say what is was I didn't like, but I did not like it.  I read maybe two books a day, many more than once.  This will never get a second look.  Not very realistic, not sure the writer can even spell Seals. </p>

 <p> Lady operational seals ?? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Not impossible on the face of it.  Story is told, but not smoothly. I need more operational (tech) details to make it more believable. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Not recommended </p>

 <p> All of the seal series are almost identical. No imagination needed. Would not recommend  this series to anyone.written for kids. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Amateur writing couldn't get past 42% on my kindle </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Honestly this book about drove me crazy.  The story sounded interesting but the writing was so bad I couldn't take it anymore.  Who uses terms like...daring feat?  Ready to finish the fight in dramatic fashion?  The fearless duo? The men jumped out to assist their brave companions?  Aaaaag. It's not just the corny lines that were maddening, the way the story flows and how the characters interacted was too simple and cheesy.  Enough, I can not recommend this book to anyone... Sorry! </p>

 <p> the story was ok.  it came across as a book written for preteens.  the interaction between individuals was just childish, I don't know anyone that talks like that. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>
