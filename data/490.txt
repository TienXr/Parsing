 <p> I find the whole idea of polygamy fascinating, and I&#8217;m a fan of the TV reality shows Sister Wives and My Five Wives. I also write spanking romance. So when I heard of Rayanna Jamison&#8217;s spanking fiction novella featuring a polygamous family, well, I couldn&#8217;t buy it fast enough!Although newlyweds Ben and Mollie intend to live a polygamous lifestyle, relationships are tested when a new wife enters the picture just months after their marriage.Unlike most spanking fiction, Bride Too Soon is a not a romance, but a friendship story that deals more with the dynamics between the two sister wives than between the wives and their husband. The story has plenty of spanking, but no sex scenes.I really enjoyed this book and found it interesting and well-written. It made me wonder how many polygamous families might actually practice domestic discipline. </p>

 <p> Bride Two Soon is about Ben and Mollie who have only been married for two months when Mollie's bestfriend Beth Anne chooses Ben as here husband. Mollie is instantly furious about the prospect of having Beth Anne as a sister wife. As Beth Ann works her way into the family, she chooses to try to get rid of her.Bride Two Soon shows a polygamist relationship more realistically. It isn't all sunshine and roses like the tv shows portray. It can be a hard adjustment on all involved in the new marriage.I laughed, rooted for Mollie, and teared up for Beth Ann. My biggest brag to Rayanna is her ability to let us know the guilt Ben feels over spanking her knowing she is emotionally unstable.Rayanna shows this emotion perfect and while I read a lot of spanking stories, she is the first author to let us into how to male is feeling and his point of view. I thoroughly enjoyed Rayanna and cannot wait to read more from her. </p>

 <p> When I read on Facebook that an acquaintance was writing a &#34;polygamy spanking romance,&#34; I was thrilled! As a devoted polyamorist, I love reading about polygamy, the ways it's different and the same as what I live my polyamory.  So as soon as Blushing Books released the book, I went and bought a copy. The blurb absolutely sold me on the book- best friends about to become sister wives after the first wife was married to the husband only a short time? Wow! I loved the way Rayanna worked through the issues of the best friends, Molly and Beth Anne; I enjoyed seeing the work these women did to regain their friendship and expand it as sister wives, both in love with the same man, Ben- who was gloriously clueless about the workings of women's relationships and needed his father's staid advice on returning the peace to his household. I didn't see anywhere in blurbs etc that this is a clean book, in other words, without sex scenes, but I find I enjoyed the story, the romance, and the friendships so much in the book that I didn't miss the graphic sexual scenes at all. I can't wait for the next book! </p>

 <p> Wonderful "clean" polygamous spanking romance- because polygamy is more than sex </p>

 <p> This is a good story about a polygamous community that believes God sends a woman the name of her future husband in a dream or vision. The woman then brings the name to the Bishop who will pray over the names until he can confirm it is from God.  Ben and Molly have been married for a few months when their Bishop informs them that Molly's best friend, Beth Ann has received Ben as the name of her husband, too. Molly is very angry. She firmly believes in this lifestyle but had hoped for at least a year alone with Ben before a second wife was added. Ben has his hands full as Molly and Beth Ann fight tooth and nail, and he's not even aware of all that is going on. I really liked the concept of this story but found that the polygamy part of it got lost and it just seemed like two friends fighting. I am anxious to read more in this series and hope to read more of the dynamics of a polygamous relationship. </p>

 <p> Anyone who is interested in the polygamy lifestyle--and I certainly am--will enjoy this tale of two best friends who have to learn to deal with the fact that they will share a husband. I really felt for Molly, who is sure that Ben will love his new wife more. I also enjoyed learning about this interesting culture. </p>

 <p> Ok, first let me say that this is a story about a polygamous family.  Yes, there is religion, but it is not shoved in your face.  In this community, women are given a vision or a dream about the man they are to marry and they take the name to their bishop and he decides if it is God&#8217;s will.  Beth Anne had a vision that she would marry Ben.  But, Ben and her best friend Mollie are already married and they have only been married for three months.  Normally there is a longer time between marriages.  Mollie is very unhappy (to say the least!) about this development and she throws a very large temper tantrum over it.  She gets a very severe spanking from Ben because of it the next time.During the courting period for Ben and Beth Anne, there is anger and resentment between the best friends.  They each do nasty things to the other, but Ben is unaware of the problems.  They have a ceasefire for the wedding, but after that they went back to their fighting.  It got bad, but finally the situation was resolved and they started to become a family.There are really good punishment spankings in this book.  My biggest complaint is that this is a short story and the ending is very abrupt.  I can see from the title that this book will be a series, so I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s why the story ended so abruptly.  I really wish that authors would go back to fewer longer stories instead of lots of novellas.  I would willingly pay more if the story was longer.  I give this 4 stars. </p>

 <p> This is my first book about two wives and one husband and I really enjoyed it.  Ben tried so hard to make sure everyone was happy and he spent time with both his wives.  At the beginning I felt really bad for Molly cause she was so newly married and was having someone else move in to her life with her husband so soon after they were married.  I understood how Molly could be upset about her best friend becoming part of their family.  Molly and Beth Anne both tried to upset each other - they knew what to do to cause trouble for the other - they have been best friends for a very long time.In the end Ben asked his dad for advice on how to make living with two wives work for his new family.  His advice was helpful and Ben was always fair when punishing either wife.I could recommend this book and I hope Rayanna Jamison continues with this story and can't wait for her next book </p>

 <p> This is a book based on a polygamy relationship between Molly and her new husband Ben.  They have only been wed for 3 months when Molly's childhood best friend, Beth, tells the bishop that she was told in her vision that she is also to marry Ben.  Can the best friends remain friends when sharing a man they both love dearly?  The book is full of back and forth mischief between the two women as they attempt to adjust to a life they have committed to.  Ben needs to discover if he can be the man they both need - both in loving them as well as taking them in hand so that he can make them see they all need to be a unified family.  It had a very interesting plot and I only wish it had been longer and explained more about how others in the community felt or dealt with the emotional feelings I think any woman would have in sharing her home and her husband. </p>

 <p> Mollie and Beth Anne are best friends who grew up in a polygamist community. Mollie gets married to Ben, and all is happy and jolly. Until their bishop tells Ben he is also slated to marry Beth Anne. Since he and Mollie haven&#8217;t been married long enough to get out of the honeymoon phase, this is a stunning blow to both of them. Mollie takes it especially hard, and jealousy rears its ugly head. When Beth Anne moves in, all hell breaks loose.I like what this book represents: a different, wholesome way of life, where multiple &#8220;wives&#8221; are accepted and the outside world isn&#8217;t a party to their personal relationships. I could really get on my soapbox here and write a laundry list of why polygyny ought to be acceptable, even in these modern feminist times, but I won&#8217;t. And bride Two Soon stays clear of proselytizing as well. In Jamison&#8217;s world the tale is all that matters, and if the reader accepts that this is a story about another lifestyle, they&#8217;ll be spellbound.Bride Two Soon is more than a clever title (though it really is clever). It&#8217;s a spanking romance with a tender twist that shines a light on a different way to structure relationships. There are plenty of spankings and lots of romance, wrapped in a highly entertaining story. I recommend Bride Two Soon to anyone who believes that romance comes in all kinds of packages. </p>

 <p> I've had a &#34;Secret* interest/fetish polygamist marriages for a while, (Okay, I admit mostly since I started watching sister wives.) This book was perfectly done. Not too harsh, not too graphic. Rayanna Jamison has obviously done her research and I can't wait to see what she writes next. Ben and Mollie were perfect together when left alone- but when you add a bestfriend to the mix well things are going to get HOT! This book sizzles from page one all the way to the end. I went back and forth rooting for Mollie and then to Beth Anne, loving both of them in completely different ways. Owen was a hoot and the story would have been lost without him. I hope there will be more from Rayanna and soon! </p>

 <p> This is a story of a young family in a polyagamous community.  I have always been intrigued by this way of life because women are generally mean.  Multiple women sharing a husband should spell disaster but this has been a way of life for many years now and continues. I really enjoyed this book especially when Ben required advice from his father on how to adjust to this new challenge.  I really hope there will be more. </p>

 <p> I do not normally read books of this genre, but when I read the first page, I knew I was in for a good ride. I love Rayanna's writing style--not too flowery with overuse of adjectives that can distract. The story of the newly wed couple, adding another bride because of a vision makes for a very good plot: Two dogs, one bone . . . in this case, it's two wives, one husband. The conflict offers great reading. The author &#34;tells&#34; the story rather than &#34;shows&#34; it. She is able to take her readers on an emotional journey. After all, that's what great writing is supposed to do. </p>

 <p> I was pleasantly surprised by this story. I found it a delight to read. Beth Anne and Mollie make this book a unforgettable read. Poor Ben is the unsuspecting husband caught in the middle. But Ben does figure them out and puts an end to their fighting with a firm hand. The laughter, the tears,the ups and downs definitely make this a book you won't want to miss reading. I look forward to reading more of this series. </p>
