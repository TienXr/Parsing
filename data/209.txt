 <p> Engaging in this movie stimulates our mind about our life and the inevitable death.  This 2001 Czech movie provokes one to ponder if you can seriously enjoy and be amused in old age, or will you obsess with preparing for your mortality?With poignancy and humor, an aging man,  Fanda doesn't take life serious, while his nagging wife, Emilie, remains so frustrated with him as she constantly obsesses over  preparations for their deaths.  Their grown son, contributes to the aura of doom by pressuring the couple to a retirement home so he can have the apartment.  We learn that the couple have nothing in common as they live their remaining years.Fanda is interested in enjoying life!  He lives life for today, and while death is certain, it is not on his mind.  Together, with his best friend, they embark on schemes, cheating, lying, conning, simply for amusement.  Most scheming or conning is harmless, but it can get out of hand.We sympathize with both, because in reality, most people tend to reflect Emilie's position, and we so much want to enjoy life like Fanda, minus the scheming and conning.The movie begs the question, do I want to live before I die, or die while I'm alive.  Ironically, Vlastimil Brodsk, (Fanda) took his own life shortly after filming the movie.  This is a wonderful movie that has garnered numerous awards......Rizzo </p>

 <p> There are certainly some memorable scenes in this film, but as a whole it just didn't quite work for me.Vlastimil Brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character: Fanda, a maddening yet adorable grandpa, oh-so-young-at-heart, oh-so-mischievious and impish, but somehow oh-so-good-hearted and harmless that you can't help loving him warts and all.In fact, that's one of the fatal flaws of this movie: the lack of any dark side to any of the characters.  They're all basically harmless Walt Disney types, even the bumbling and self-absorbed son.  There are no real consequences to Brodsky's actions other than Stella (his wife) finally talking divorce but it's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she'll come back to him.  There is no center, no force or dynamic power in this film---it's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you don't want to hurt the feelings of your host.The ending also relies on another lazy device, the virtual deux ex machina in the person of Stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice/supporter of Fanda's when she sees that his attempt at self-reform is only making him miserable.This film might've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with Fanda's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death, instead of focusing on how clever, audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is, which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse, narcissism.  One wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with Mr. Brodsky, who is a towering figure among Czech actors, that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him.A more accurate title for this movie, especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll, might be: "The Fantasy Life of a Poor Old Man." </p>

 <p> I'm a little surprised that no other Amazon reviewers have posted anything on this Czech charmer.  This is definitely the kind of "in-theaters" sleeper that usually inspires a few "snap-up-the-DVD-the-moment-it's-released" reviews.  Justifiably so in this case.  When I took it in recently, on a friend's recommendation, there was applause over the closing credits, and for once, that kind of reaction didn't seem ludicrous to me.AUTUMN SPRING is a gentle comedy about one's man refusal to "go gentle into that good night."  A prankster, whose usually innocent practical jokes do no harm and keep the specter of debility and death at least somewhat at bay, Frantisek (Fanda) Hana does get in a bit over his head at times.  When one of his jokes backfires, resulting in substantial financial loss, it strains his marriage to the more staid, long-suffering Stella. When a follow-up prank has him feigning his death and leaving Stella distraught, she feels compelled to seek divorce--after 44 years of marriage.It's fairly easy to predict whether or not Stella will go through with the divorce.  But the scene in which she reconsiders and he vows to mend his ways is so deftly acted, so understated, that its transcends cliche.  Indeed everything about this movie is pitched just right.  I hate to speak ill of my native land's film industry--and Hollywood CAN do some things right.  But the last thing I would want to see is an American re-make of this quiet, and quietly funny little gem.The one negative print review I've read of this film took note that--unlike the life-affirming Fanda--the celebrated Czech actor,Vlastimil Brodsky (CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS, JACOB THE LIAR), who portrayed him committed suicide shortly after the film was completed.  Some will see a certain irony in that, but the reviewer's claim that this tragic real-life turn of events "refutes" the point of the film is, at the very least, arguable.  We don't know if Fanda would ever take his own life, or under what circumstances he might.  What we do know is that, for as long as he is able and alert, he will continue to live his life to the fullest, and drive all around him crazy in doing so. </p>

 <p> This sweet czech film is about an old man who refuses to join the cult of &quot;waiting for death&quot; that most of the aged around him, included his wife, seem to think is the only appropriate way to be. He and his buddy are terminal pranksters who try to milk every bit of fun out of their existience as they can, much to the consternation of his family, who wants him to settle down and act like his life is over. This is truly touching in moments, quietly funny in others and very life affirming altogether. The acting is restrained, but suitably and realistically human. Nothing really stands out on a technical level, but it doesn't need to with such endearing characters. </p>

 <p> Please don't listen to the one reviewer who gave this a bad review. He is  very confused. This movie will make you laugh and cry! A great film that does not pretend to be something it's not! Just don't take my word for it. Here are some awards: Winner audience award for Best film Clevland International Film Festivl, St. Louis Film Festival, Official selection Toronto International Film Festival, 4 Czech Lion awards, and the list goes on!!!!!  This is a film that should not be missed! Viewers if someone gives a bad review of some film do me a favor and check the movies they liked {such as the critic of this film who liked a UFC film} before you listen to their advice! </p>

 <p> I thought my husband had really lost his marbles when he brought this video home for us to watch - but how wrong I was. It's a gem, a winner, over-the-top wonderful. There are really only 3 characters in it (with a small part played by the couple's womanizing adult son): Fanda and his wife, Emilie, and Fanda's friend and partner in innocent crime, Eda.Emilie is obsessed with saving money in little cans, each with its own purpose, but the can that preoccupies her for 9/10 of the movie is the one where she's saving for their funeral expenses. All of her talk is about their deaths, their funerals, what music, what will be posted in the newspapers - and in her amble spare time, she wants to visit cemeteries and take care of graves.Fanda? Well, Fanda would rather live than die, and if he had his druthers, he'd like to live the good life. He and Eda sneak off to tour estates that are for sale (posing, of course, as wealthy prospective clients), trick pretty girls into kissing them as a bribe. He likes to smoke, drink good liquor, take French lessons, laugh, and enjoy life.Their son wants to move them out of their already cramped apartment and into a retirement home so he can take over their apartment. Emilie is - - - oh, fergeddit. I'm telling too much. I don't want to spoil if for anyone. Just trust me on this and watch the movie. I guarantee you'll emerge grinning. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful film. </p>

 <p> Not much I can say here that others haven't said.  The movie is about what it is truly like to grow old and realize the cruel reality of what nature does to us and the narrow choices that become available if you make it this far in life.  Is it better to die young and miss this state of affairs altogether?  Well, this man Fanda, decides bravely, that he's not going to live the later years of his life in typical fashion planning for the inevitable.  He'd rather live this part of his life like he did in his youth and let death take care of itself.  Is there a real life lesson to be had in this movie?  You bet there is!  And before it's over, Fanda's wife catches on too.  A wonderful story about REAL love.  The kind that grows with time and becomes so rooted that neither one can even attend the mere thought of living without the other.  Some people don't believe it exists.  IT EXISTS.  I know because I've been with the same person for almost 40 years.I find myself wishing once again that Hollywood would learn a lesson from some of these foreign film makers and create some movies with some depth and stop depending continuously on special effects, sex, explosions, murder and mayhem.  In this country we've become all flash and little substance.  Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you should.  Anyway, read the subtitles and enjoy a really great movie.  Pass the popcorn! </p>

 <p> I can't really add anything to the first three reviews posted here; they're accurate and perceptive.I DO feel compelled to correct Chris Cox's contention that there is no technical excellency here -- in addition to wonderful performances from every member of the cast, a touching and delicate script, wonderful music, great sound and deft direction, I was astounded by the cinematography and especially the lighting.  Every scene is beautifully lit, especially the outdoor scenes.Perhaps Chris missed this because it is one aspect of filmmaking which is usually most apparent when poorly done. </p>

 <p> I must admit: this film is cute and it does have some nice funny scenes.  But take it easy, it is not a great film.  I found it to be alternately engaging and then distancing.  I also found myself waiting for it to end already; also not a good sign.  There are some good ancillary performances from the other actors, but on the whole I found this to be surprisingly shallow. </p>

 <p> I couldn't agree with the fellow reviewer who said that this is one of those "sleeper" movies that could go unnoticed very easily. I have been watching a lot of Czech movies and bumped into this one by happenstance. Needless to say, it is one of the best I've seen so far.Frantisek Hana is in his mid-seventies, but possesses an unbridled zeal for life. He is enchanted by blooming flowers and beautiful sunny days and revels in the tiny pleasures derived by playing child-like pranks. His partner in crime is Ed and the duo celebrates their old age by living life to the hilt. In one of their pranks, Hana & Ed portray themselves as wealthy expats, planning to buy a palatial mansion. They get a free limousine ride to the countryside mansion and some fine wine. However, their little prank blows up as the estate agent manages to find their true identity and slaps a 30000 Krown fine. Multiple attempts (pranks really) to raise the fine money leads them into funny and hilarious situations, emphasizing the serendipitous nature of life. Having exhausted all pranktical means, Hana eventually steals the money from his "funeral" fund.This severely infuriates his wife, who is a perfect antipode. She has surrendered to old age and lives under the morbid ambition of being buried in a second-hand grave and saves furiously for her funeral. She has worked out all the post-death formalities and even selected a picture that'll appear alongside her epitaph.Hana's domestic life is the usual grind. His wife condemns him for being crazy and not taking his old age seriously, while his son is eying his apartment for his ex-wives and children. The ensuing movie drama will take you through scary divorce threats, deadly pranks, emotional courtroom scenes, endless love, compassionate & unconditional friendship and woes of aging bodies.However, everything has severe underpinnings of humor, which is a synonym for being alive. Stellar performance by Vlastimil Brodsk.This is how movies should be made ... </p>

 <p> This movie is being marketed as a comedy. While it had a few scenes in it with comic elements, it iss by no means a comedy. I would even be reluctant to call it a dramady. It is a drama with a few funny scenes. I laugh more when I watch "Ordinary People," and a lot of people think that is a grim movie.Or put it another way that shouldn't spoil the story, the topic at hand is an elderly couple dealing with death different ways.I won't say anymore about that because then it wouldn't be worth watching for those who want to watch movies about dealing with death, but it is not a movie to ease your burdened soul through mirth. </p>
