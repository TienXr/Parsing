<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> The true origins of the Faith movement </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> "A Different Gospel" by D.R. McConnell is a classical exposure of the Faith movement, the ostensibly Christian and charismatic movement associated with Kenneth Hagin and Kenneth Copeland (in Sweden, Ulf Ekman). What makes this book so fascinating, is that the author is both a charismatic minister (in Holland, of all places) and a person with scholarly training. His book is both a thoroughly documented scholarly work, and a theological polemic. It's sometimes referenced in other scholarly works. But please note that McConnell recieved his degree at the Oral Roberts University, a charismatic school in Oklahoma!The main thesis of "A Different Gospel" is that the origins of the Faith movement cannot be traced to the Holiness or Pentecostal traditions within American Christianity, nor to the charismatic revivals after World War II, as claimed by other scholars. Rather, Kenneth Hagin, widely recognized as the founder of the Faith movement, got his ideas from E.W. Kenyon, an independent preacher and writer who was neither a Wesleyan nor a Pentecostal. Kenyon was heavily influenced by New Thought and Christian Science, two non-traditional groups often regarded as cults. McConnell thoroughly documents both Kenyon's similarities to the "metaphysical" groups, and proves that Kenyon attended a college whose faculty and students supported New Thought. He also proves that Hagin extensively plagiarized Kenyon's writings, often word for word! Of course, Hagin claims to have gotten his ideas straight from Jesus himself.Despite being critical of Kenyon's theology, McConnell is surprisingly charitable to him, claiming that Kenyon was misguided rather than malicious, and that he simply wanted to restore the supernatural healing ministry of the Church, something downplayed by the liberal theologians, and also combat New Thought and Christian Science using their own weapons. The author's assesment of Hagin and the Faith movement is less charitable, however, and here he obviously has a point. Many groups within the Faith movement indeed seem to be cultic or cults. (To me, what defines a cult is the use of manipulation and exploitation. McConnell uses a more theological definition.)Those interested in the Faith movement and the conflicts surrounding it, should also read Hank Hanegraaf's "Christianity in Crisis", another polemical book, but one that goes even deeper into exposing the weird ideas and aberrant practices of the Faith movement.While I never liked the Faith movement, I always assumed that Faith theology was at bottom evangelical or Pentecostal, with the "prosperity gospel" tacked on as an additional bonus. Indeed, the main Faith congregation here in Sweden, Livets Ord, seems to have moved in such a direction: from an aberrant cult to a group blending main-stream Christianity with the prosperity gospel. However, the books by McConnell and Hanegraaf shows that Faith theology in its pure form has very little to do with main-stream Christianity, or even "regular" Bible belt fundamentalism. Rather, it's a truly bizarre melange of notions reminescent of Gnosticism, Mormonism and Christian Science. Actually, McConnell is somewhat moderate in his criticism of the Faith movement, compared to Hanegraaf who at length documents all their quirky notions (God looks like a man, Heaven is a planet, Adam could fly to the Moon, etc).Both books are recommended. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> D.R. McConnell's research is up to date and well written. As to the charges that Kenneth Hagin is guilty of plagiarism, the evidence is beyond question. McConnell gives insight into Hagin's clearly unbiblcal teachings and false, heretical visions. He exposes the fact that Hagin's visions are blatant lies and deceptions and supports his claims by quoting the appropriate Scriptures without falling into the trap of biblicism. I would like to make a brief comment regarding "Dr." James Maceys' review: experience, rather than exegesis, seems to be his way of proving his point. Since he has taken the liberty to write a rather lenghty review I must ask why I has not invested a little extra time in giving us some Scriptural insight. I seriously doubt that this man has an earned doctorate, for anyone with a smatter of Biblical knowledge would not be able to come to any other conclusion that Hagin is a heretic and with little Biblical knowledge, and even the little bit he does "know" is twisted beyond recognition. McConnell gives us evidence beyond a shadow of a doubt that Hagin is guilty raping the Scriptures to suite himself and trying to back up false teachings with visions from a Jesus of his own imagination </p>

 <p> The prosperity Gospel is occultic in origin, as has been shown by the author, and he exposes all the far-reaching errors and miscues of this 'Gospel' and it's proponents. I had a very deep background in the occult 'sciences' before I chose Christ-following as an adult. Everything that I was confounded with as a new born-again Christian in the late 1970's was exactly what has been described by Dan McConnell in this book. Yes, Jesus promises us His peace, healing and prosperity, but He also promises that the world will hate us as they hated Him...to expect tribulations, trials and difficulties. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> McConnell's timeline proven wrong... </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>
  04-07-2000  
<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> D.R. McConnell's book has negatively influenced many readers concerning the word of faith, or simply, faith message.In it, he puts forth a thesis that Kenyon was cultic and that Hagin, by including extensive amounts of Kenyon's words in his teachings, is cultic as well--thus making the whole of the word of faith one big aberrant camp.Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, researchers Joe Mcintyre and Paul King did extensive research and they have proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that Kenyon could not have been influenced by metaphysics or such like. The reason is because the timeline put forth by McConnell has been shown to be in error. Kenyon attended Emerson school of oratory but left before it became a hotbed of metaphysical teaching. McConnell's dates do not add up and contradict Kenyon's own testimony as to when he attended and when he left.The other problem is that when we, as the church, look to the cults to decide what we do and do not believe to be orthodox, we have already fallen into satan's trap. He always has counterfeits, and if you drop a teaching simply because it "sounds like" something the cults teach, you are doing your theology wrong.The Bible is the sole source of faith and practice. And regardless of what the cults teach, if we see something in the scriptures and it is right, then it is right regardless of how much or how little it resembles something in the cults. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> When looking for truth, it's often helpful to look at the origins of different movements and theologies. As Jesus said, if the tree is bad, so is its fruit. Look at the origins of today's cults and alternative religions. Look at the lives, the teachings, and the circumstances surrounding their founders and the introduction of their holy books. Then compare them to the life of Christ and the writing of the New Testament. Suddenly, things become much more clear.So it is with many of today's popular Christian theologies, including the Faith Movement. "Faith" teachings SOUND good, and their supporters can pull isolated scriptures from the Bible to support their position. But as McConnell meticulously documents, the origins of this teaching are not in scripture, but in occult doctrine, brought into the church by an unwitting pastor in the early 20th century. Those teachings have now become mainstreamed, and their origins so separated from the teachings themselves, that the occult power that drives them is known by few.There is power in the Faith Movement teaching -- miracles are performed -- but just because something is supernatural doesn't make it from God. This is an absolute MUST READ for anyone involved in the Faith Movement or considering its teachings. </p>

 <p> This book is a good study tool and how doubters think.  I've studied the faith movement, and I found that God initiated it with creation. So, I doubt that you will find that this book will be able to succeed against God and His faith movement.  I know that there are vessel out there with &quot;Big names&quot;, but can God not make them big, when they teach his Word?  Even John was made &quot;Big&quot; by saying &quot;I must decrease, so that He can increase&quot;.  No, the movment that is really criticized here by McConnell is the Doubt Movement, which was initiated, not by God, as McConnell would so subtly and ignorantly suggest, but by Lucifier. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Important book, but...... </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The Word of Faith Gospel, the un-Christian doctrine that true believers are entitled to perfect health and material prosperity, is an excellent and deserving subject for attack, and Mr. McConnell does a great job tearing down some of its pillars, but I'm afraid "A Different Gospel" is lacking in several respects. This book, while eminently valuable, is hobbled by Mr. McConnell's own theological preconceptions and would probably be ineffective in convincing a "Word of Faith" true believer.First, the positives: Mr. McConnell proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Kenneth Hagin, the purported father of the WoF doctrine, actually plagiarized it from an evangelist named E.W. Kenyon who in turn had cribbed his ideas from the New Age/New Thought metaphysical cults of the late 1800s. McConnell details the bizarre claims of Hagin to perfect health, supernatural visitations, divine revelations and travels to both Heaven and Hell. It's too bad this book couldn't be updated to include the details about Hagin's poor health that were revealed after his death from heart disease. McConnell also talks about the many deaths resulting from the WoF doctrine, as its diehard adherents rejected medical treatment for even fatal illnesses. The second part of the book also offers a Biblical argument against the various tenets of WoF theology.The problems: firstly, a full half of the book is devoted to exposing Hagin's plagiarism of and indebtedness to E.W. Kenyon. The specter of Kenyon and his associates looms over the rest of the book as well, as McConnell's arguments frequently rely on associating WoF's doctrines with Kenyon and the "metaphysical cults." To me, that's not very effective. The charismatic movement isn't exactly known for its devotion to doctrinal purity or its vast historical perspective, so the connection to Kenyon isn't exactly damning and probably leaves most WoF people staring blankly. Besides, guilt by association isn't an argument. In any case, Word-of-Faith's defenders could simply say, as they have, that Kenyon simply extracted long-forgotten Biblical truths from the New Thought cults without being tainted by their other un-Christian ideas. For McConnell, while he did well by citing the many Bible verses condemning riches and acknowledging sickness among believers, seems to deliberately ignore the several inconvenient verses that the movement cites as proof texts. (MK 11:22-24), (JN 14:12-13), (JN 15:16), (JN 16: 23-24), (JAM 1:6-8), among others. While I think that WoF is absolutely ridiculous, those verses have to be explained, and I don't think McConnell does so.I think the author's own background as a graduate of Oral Roberts University prevents him from really getting to the heart of the WoF heresy. D.R. McConnell is a self-described "charismatic". He believes in faith healing, he believes in continuing revelation, he comes from a 100 year young faith tradition whose distinctives broke with everything that Christianity (whether Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox) had ever taught. He believes that any ordinary Joe can just start his own "church", and not be subject to any authority except the whims of his own internal "Holy Spirit". I think his position on WoF is right, but with that theological background, where does he think he gets the standing to throw around charges of "heresy"?  WoF people can very easily ask how McConnell can prove that Hagin didn't get a new revelation from God and that his (McConnell's) Biblical interpretation is the right one. They'd be correct to ask, "Who is he to tell us what is right and wrong?"Although in one way it was good that this argument could be made to the WoF people by one of their own, McConnell was the wrong messenger for the above reasons.  McConnell actually grants that all of these miracles are taking place in WoF churches. Wouldn't that lend validity to their beliefs then?? Who would reject a miraculous cure because the pastor's theology was influenced by the bogeyman Kenyon?? Reality should have been invoked: What should have been said was that there has never been one proven miracle healing in a charismatic church, whether WoF or not. WoF adherents are no more healthy or wealthy than any other group of people in the same socioeconomic category. They get sick and die in the same numbers as everyone else and the only people really raking in the money are the con-artist ministers at the top of the pyramid scheme. The sicknesses and early deaths of so many WoF leaders should also have been mentioned. And finally, what should have been cited in support of the Biblical arguments were the Church's historical interpretation of the controversial verses, as well as its historical teachings on faith, private revelation, authority, wealth and healing. Is the weight of all of Christian history insignificant? WoF is unhistorical, un-Christian and deadly. This book provides some good ammunition, but lacks a logical consistency that prevents it from being the final argument. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Examination of the Word of Faith </p>


<h2> REVIEW DATE </h2>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This book is a popular critique of the Word of Faith movement, which includes preachers as Kenneth Copeland, Joel Osteen, and Kenneth Hagan.  What is interesting is that the author D.R. McConnell was associated with Oral Roberts University and, as a graduate of ORU myself, I'd say that Oral was as much a part of the Word of Faith as anyone (with his Seed Faith and Expect a Miracle teaching).  I have wondered why McConnell wrote this book.  E.W. Kenyon was a major developer of the Word of Faith teaching, and, according to McConnell, he was, at least indirectly, influenced by New Thought (i.e. Unity School of Christianity and Religious Science).  He says that Kenyon critiqued, yet also incorporated New Thought ideas (i.e. positive thinking, &#34;releasing&#34; faith).  This book is a study of Word of Faith history and teaching.  In contemporary Christianity, it is a powerful movement.  Like any religious movement, it has its positive and negative features, but I will say this for Word of Faith--as one who is a seminary graduate, exposed to textual analysis and higher criticism, such teaching loses the power inherent in faith. Faith can become intellectual and that loses its whole point.  If faith doesn't make a difference, what good is it?  Faith should be practical and life-changing, not just an intellectal exercise.  I, personally, am a follower of Unity, and it is not the demon that McConnell and Kenyon depicts.  McConnell's book provides an historical background for the Word of Faith movement, but I'd not shortchange  the intent of the movement itself.  If it can make faith alive and poweful, more power to it! </p>

 <p> A Different Gospel examines the Word of Faith doctrines which have become increasingly popular within Pentecostalism.  I would stress however that Word of Faith is a stream within Pentecostalism and although Word of Faith  people tend to be Pentecostal, not all Pentecostals would be Word of Faith.  McConnell looks at the origins of the Word of Faith and in particular the  Father figure of the movement, E.W. Kenyon.McConnell examines Word of  Faith teachings and shows from scripture that there is some  error.McConnell is a Pentecostal so he is writing objectively.  I have  to admire how gracious he is throughout the book to the people he is  writing about.If you want to know about the Word of Faith movement, I  would strongly recommend this book. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I am a Pentecostal minister who, about 35 years ago, was a deacon in a church that embraced the Word-Faith teaching. I have looked quite thoroughly into the subject matter myself and can vouch for McConnell's research and conclusions. Criticisms that he did not fully relate all of the influences on Kenyon's theology would be valid if this were a biography -- which it is not (even Rob Bowman echoes this illogical criticism). McConnell faithfully documents how mind science teaching influenced Kenyon, who passed it along to the plagiarizer, Hagin (and thus to the whole W/F movement). McConnell is a charismatic believer with no axe to grind against non-cessationists. He is also a skilled theologian who systematically provides the scriptural alternative to W/F error. I think McConnell would do well to leave Hank's foreword out of the next edition, though. Hank has his own problems and these should not distract the reader from the good content of this book. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Still the idea persists that faith is believing sth strongly enough to make it happen. The delusion is usually found among those who imagine they hold to a scientific religion. Science works to consistent laws. It is commonly taught, especially by those in the so-called faith movement, that there is a "law" of faith that works like gravity and if we obey that law, what we desire will be granted automatically like the reaction of molecules.But these people oversee that the realm of spirit and the realm of the material world are not the same. The physical laws which according to the Christian belief God has established are intended to control man and to limit what we can do in God`s universe. But this presumed law of faith does just the opposite. It allows each person to become a "god" waving a magic wand over the physical universe.But what? Did not Jesus himself say: Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you (John 16,23)!"? Is this like Sesame opening? No , because the Bible has given the reasonable limitation, that first of all not everybody is qualified to ask . In James 4,3 it says: "You ask and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it upon your lusts." Just look what for the people pray and tell me their lust!Why should God answer prayers if He wants sth else than the one who asks! Therefore Christians are even advised in the "Lord`s Prayer" to pray: "Faher, your will be done!" Gods will not mans will! Mans task seems to be to will God`s will! We have chaos enough on Earth! It would be not a good idea to fulfil everybody`s hottest wishes! Think of the fervent prayers of Islam-terrorists to destroy America and whole Christianity!Very similar to the faith movement within charismatic and Pentecostal circles is the New Thought Alliances of churches. They all claim to be Christian, but they are outside the Biblical Christianity. Such groups include Christian Science, Science of Mind and many others. They believe in an all-powerful universal Mind that exists to serve mankind. Oddly this great Mind apparently has no mind of its own but is ever ready to turn wishes into white elephants. It is typical for the self-centered human ego to believe in that what self-centered Satan professes "I will be like the most High!" Another trial of man to come a little closer to be himself God!Rather apparent is that this movement seems to be another link to New Age and other religions of self-centeredness. Hinduism for example holds a similar belief. It denies objective reality and claims that we (or the Great Self which is in every single self) have created with our minds an imaginary universe. The great illusion- maya it is thankfully named. By changing our thinking the result must inevitably be the change of the universe. Hitler only thought wrong! Or not! Think pink! Or Visualize peace! And it will happen. So called Positive Mental Attitude seminars and much success training in the business worlds involve similar fantasy - the idea that we can create success only with the power of positive thinking. According to some professing Christians Positive Thinking or Possibility Thinking are synonymous for faith! But atheists can say the same! The Bible says (Romans 10,17): "Faith comes by hearing...the word of God!" It is obvious that Biblical Faith and spiritual faith are different.Books which are warning Christians from non-biblical practises need be in order to discern Biblical from non-biblical teachings and hint at the common movement in the world of today, in which the differences of religions disappear according to the growing tolerance for everything which is not good according to the biblical teaching. Those who do not want to be warned in the way the apostle Paul warned the Christians in all his letters and Jesus warned the people in all four Gospels, could at least keep to the advice: "Test it and keep what is good!" But for the good it seems that again the Bible must be the orientation for Christians and not eastern philosophy. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is a book that tells the truth. I have always believed that truth is truth, even if nobody believes it, and falsehood is falsehood, even if everybody believes it. The word-faith movement is big, what with the TBN television network and other big names promoting it, but that doesn't make it truthful. It is almost embarassing to say that I was raised a Pentecostal, because most of Christendom today (and non-Christians, for that matter) identify me with this movement. It is indeed an heretical movement, based on the teachings of Kenyon, who was steeped in the Eastern idea of there being a god within each of us, and the idea that Jesus was someone who needed a regeneration of his own heart after the death on the cross (discounting the orthodox Christian idea of a sinless man having broken the chains of death, hell, and the grave). This movement is based on Eastern concepts, but because it has  taken on the terminology and outward appearances of Pentecostalism (speaking in tongues, on-the-spot translation, faith healing), many believe it to represent Pentecostalism. Nothing could be further from the truth. One only needs to ask an older member of a mainstream Pentecostal church (Church of God, Assembly of God) to find out this isn't so.Classic Pentecostalism has always maintained that there is no such thing as a "free lunch" in this fallen, sinful world, even for saints. We will all grow old and die (the death rate is still one per person, as Hank Hanegraaf says), and there is no guarantee of wealth in this life. Just because someone is a "child of God" is no guarantee of continued health and wealth. Both the godly and ungodly include the poor and sick. In fact, Jesus himself claims that his disciples "shall be hated of all men for my name's sake". The important things of life are not bound up in trying to surpass Bill Gates' bank account, nor in visiting the plastic surgeon past the age of 90.As we have all heard of "get rich quick" schemes, if it "sounds too good to be true, it probably is". In this case, some of these word-faith teachers are becoming wealthy off people's desire to have God's promises in this life (health and wealth forever), and are using the ploy of religious fervor to do it.McConnell has done a fantastic service by writing this book, even though sincere, dedicated Christians are unknowingly involved in this movement. He details the history of the movement to the present day, something that Hanegraaf's book didn't do. Very interesting and convincing. Would that there were more brave souls as McConnell to step forward. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Many Pentecostals and Evangelicals are so unwilling to bend their pride and allow a book, a teacher, or even the Bible itself to teach them God's truth.  Like the Pharisees of old, many are so stuck in their traditions and idealogy that they refuse to read any other books unless they agree with it.  Surely many have fallen captive to Mark 7:1-13.That is the case with many reviews I have read on Dr. McConnell's well researched and well written work on the Word-Faith Movement.  In this case, Dr. McConnell has shown how key Word-Faith doctrines derived themselves in the teachings of E.W. Kenyon and then to Kenneth Hagin.  He does a great job of showing how similar Kenyon and Hagin are on various topics and leaves the reader little doubt of who copied who.I was raised Pentecostal.  I currently work in a Pentecostal church however I read many different opinions from non-charismatics to charismatics from Reformed to Baptist to Arminian.  However, I hold the Bible to be the sole authority for faith and practice (1 Timothy 4:16; 2 Timothy 3:16-4:3) and I test all things by Scripture (1 Thess. 5:21).  It's time for the Church to return to a true love for the Word of God and not for emotional, experiential, health and wealth teachings found in the minds of Word-Faith teachers and not in Scripture.  May we once again preach the Word! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Ken Hagin says of those who don't accept his message:  "I told the pastor in the next church were I went to hold a meeting, "That man will fall dead in the pulpit."  And just a very short time after that he did.  Why?  Because he didn't accept the message that God gave me to give him from the Holy Spirit" (p. 65)And what's the message?  A works-based relationship with God, carnal judgment of the poor, and curses for those bold enough to heed the call of the true Holy Spirit and confront these false teachings.Says Ken Copeland, "Jesus went into hell to free mankind from the penalty of Adam's high treason... When His blood poured out it did not atone... Jesus spent three horrible days and nights in the bowels of this earth getting back for you and me our rights with God." (p.118)Is not the whole Bible for the glory of the Son of God, Christ Crucified?  The Bible states that Jesus made peace with everything on heaven and earth by means of his BLOOD ON THE CROSS (Col. 1:20).  It was in this way that God shamed the evil rulers and authorities, by His victory over them on the CROSS OF CHRIST (Col. 2:14-15). What God wants is for us to be made holy by the SACRIFICE OF THE BODY OF JESUS once and for all time (Hebrews 10:10).Didn't Jesus say, "Father, into YOUR HANDS I commit MY SPIRIT"?  Didn't Jesus say on the cross, "This day you will be with me IN PARADISE"?  Didn't Jesus proclaim the Gospel of the VICTORIOUS CROSS to the spirits in prison?God is sovereign, God is just, and God is indeed watching all of us.  Only the Blood covers our sin --- NOT Jesus losing his divinity and being tortured by Satan and his demons (who are supposedly running hell)... --- NOT by speaking in tongues to show the indwelling of the true Holy Spirit... --- NOT by being a millionaire tv evangelist who makes up visions and plagiarizes the work of others.... NOT by healings that can't be verified.Is Jesus the eternal Son of God, whose blood alone atones for sin and makes one right with God?I'll bet it's an answer that Ken Hagin wishes that he could reteach,.... especially now that he's gone from this world and confronted with a spiritual realm that he lied of and apparently thought he would never have to confront.Did Ken Hagin die because he refused to accept the message of the Holy Spirit in "A Different Gospel"? </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Write a book like this one! McConnell wrote one of those "you either love it or hate it" books. Witness the raging reviews below!McConnell hasn't written the perfect book. There are some loose ends that could have been addressed more thoroughly. For example - if the faith preachers have it wrong, then how does faith work? What about the clear scriptures that tell us we can move mountains (Mt 21:21), rebuke storms (Lu 8:23ff), and have what we say (Mk 11:23)? Some very clear scriptures need to be addressed, IMO.However, McConnell nails many of the loose ends in the word faith / positive confession movement. Like the fact that occult groups have long taught that the forces of nature, or God, have to do what you tell them to, if you get the words right. That's the essence of magic. And it's the essence of the faith people's teaching -- You get what you say, you live your words (good or bad)...McConnell's careful footnoting connects the founders of the faith movement clearly to the occult, New Thought, and Christian Science movements.  And he raises the very relevant point - do heresy and error create orthodoxy?McConnell updated his book in the mid 90's and answered his critics. The claim that this book is dated or debunked is silly. The issues are still on the table.Get this book. It's the best, most balanced, most researched book done to date on this important rift in the church. </p>
