 <p> The best hard case protector for my iTouch!I doubt many people will buy it given the new iTouch size has changed, but if you need a nice durable and pretty hard case for your old iTOuch, go with this. Snug fit and single-piece. Once you put it on, you will never want to remove it. But when you do, it will be a snap! </p>

 <p> Excellent! </p>

 <p> everything that i expected from this item was true. i expected it to be a nice fit and for it to entertain those who look at it at first glance. even after i put it on my itouch and flipping it over, i thought "why do i have a cassette in my room?" the silicone material is easy to remove and put back. </p>

 <p> Great Item </p>

 <p> I wish the creams white would look more like white than grey white.Over all it arrive in 11 days and only paid $2 for it l.Great prices I paid $5 for my first one and both are the same exact. </p>

 <p> Pros: It's reasonably priced and it looks cool. You'll get lots of comments on it.Cons: It barely fits - it's too big for the Ipod Touch 4 (but not quite big enough for any model of Iphones - I checked with a few friends'). If you put it in your pocket, the case will most likely fall off. There's no hole for charging. I took an exacto knife and sliced myself a hole, but honestly it would be easier to just pop the case off and on when you need to charge. (The case is so loose it's not a problem). The part of the case over the volume buttons and the "sleep" button are ill-fitting and don't feel like they're at the right angle to easily push the buttons. (the buttons are at a sloped angle on the device itself, and the plastic buttons that go over them are not)All in all, get this only if you're determined to have a cassette-looking case. If you actually value form or function, look elsewhere! </p>

 <p> My daughter dropped her Itouch on the kitchen floor and the screen broke.  The only thing this protects is maybe the back of the Itouch.  All the control functions are usable which is nice though.  Shipping was fast. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> No protection at all </p>

 <p> This is a glossy, hard plastic, snap on cover.  It doesn't cover the front face of the iPod at all (unlike the two-part snap together models), but it's raised up enough such that if you place the iPod face down, the screen does not come in contact with the surface.  No interference with the screen protector that I put on either.  I put this on my 7 year old son's iPod, and he loves it.  Great price too. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> good level of protection, and a good price </p>
