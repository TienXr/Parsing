 <p> What would Shakespeare plays be like if you took away the poetry, the great speeches, all that wonderful language, and left only the plots?We find out in this collection of four Shakespeare plays adapted, shortened and brought up to date. The results are uneven but mainly pretty entertaining without ever being Shakespearian.The best of the four is the first -- "The Taming of the Shrew" -- due to the wonderful Shirley Henderson who always enlivens whatever project she graces with her talent. Here, she is a formidable mini-Margaret Thatcher aiming to become leader of the British conservative party, terrorizing her male aides and her silly supermodel sister. The adaption finds some neat ways to temper the sexism of the original to make it more palatable to modern sensibilities. It's an amusing romp.The weakest of the four in "Midsummer's Night's Dream" set in a theme park. It has some bright moments, notably the depiction of Bottom as a clueless, wannabe stand-up comedian who is desperately unfunny. But the magic doesn't work outside the Forest of Arden."Much Ado Abotu Nothing," set in a local TV newsroom, was pleasant enough. Don John, the villain in the original, here becomes rather pathetic and creepy instead of just evil."Macbeth" with James McAvoy, is set in a three-Michelin star restaurant and is downright weird. Again, the plot doesn't work in the modern setting and without the language, the play loses its grandeur and degenerates into a bloodfest.It strikes me that our enjoyment of these pieces stems from our familiarity of the originals. I enjoyed seeing how the adapters reshaped the original material. For instance the members of the watch from "Much Ado" become hapless security men. Banquo's ghost makes his presence felt first through a cellphone message. The three witches are three garbage collectors ("bin men" in English slang). I was curious how Birnam Wood would come to Dunsinane. The result was a big disappointment.If we didn't know the originals and were viewing these plays for the first time, we might find them pleasantly diverting but it's unlikely we'd regard them as masterpieces. </p>

 <p> The BBC has done it again.  Back in the 80s they produced adaptations of Shakespeare's plays.  Those were done straight.  Shakespeare Retold offers modern looks at 4 of his most beloved plays.  We have three comedies and one tragedy.  This is definitely a mixed bag.  First up is Much Ado About Nothing.  It's my favorite of his plays.  Here Benedick and Beatrice are dueling news anchors.  He stood her three years ago!  Hero is the weather girl.  Tom Jones' hit "Help Yourself" is the theme song.  I still think of Diet Dr. Pepper.  Maybe I'm prejudiced.  But this adaptation gets my vote as the best. We have humor and a little tragedy.  There's a bit involving the sonnets.  Once again the bumbling security guards save the day.  However, things don't turn out entirely like the original plays.  But this version suffers from comparisons to more "faithful" ones.  I thought that the actors slightly resembled Kenneth Braugh and Emma Thompson.  Like the earlier BBC version, Benedick gets a shave.  But it's still a delight to watch.  The take on Macbeth is rather strange indeed.  It's set in a restaurant.  This field can be rather competitive.  Macbeth is the head chef.  But the owner Duncan gets all the credit.  His son's in line to take over.  But he's not ready yet.  Macbeth's wife also works at the restaurant.  She's fully involved in the plot to murder Duncan.  This takes place off camera.  The witches are three male sanitation workers.  We get some scenes of a landfill.  This adaptation is the bloodiest.  That's just the kitchen!  See Macbeth demonstrate how to divide a pig's head.  We also get scenes of his wife washing her hands.  She has some trouble with her lipstick too.  Not surprisingly, things don't turn out well. The Taming of The Shrew is the worst of this series.  Katherine is a politician in line for her party's leadership.  Her younger sister is a supermodel.  Since Shakespeare wrote these plays, women's roles have changed a lot.  This gets reflected in these adaptations.  The decision to marry is partially politicial.  Besides, no one had asked Katherine before!  She gets a wild ride in several areas.  But does she really believe that famous speech at the end?  Stay tuned.  The last play is A Midsummer Night's Dream.  I saw a production back in college.  Here the action takes place at a holiday camp.  Hermia is set for an engagement party.  But she found someone else.  We get fairies.  Puck is a frequent presence.  Bottoms gets turned into a donkey.  Actually, it's mainly the ears.  Cupid plays havoc.  Both guys fall for Helena.  This version could have been done at an American camp.  The bonus features are sparse.  Each play has making of  interviews.  But the Macbeth one primarily deals with a stage production.  These versions won't replace the originals.  Hopefully, they'll increase interest in them.  Shakespeare often adapted his plays from other sources.  So he'd probably be amused by these treatments. </p>

 <p> There are two basic requirements for a successful adaptation, 1) it must remain faithful to the original idea of the author, and 2) it must be able to stand on its own.  Of the four Shakespeare plays adapted for this collection, only one fulfilled both of those criteria.  The other three, while well acted, fell far short of the mark.Much Ado About Nothing was the only one of the four productions to stand on its own two feet.  It was funny, well written, engaging, and wonderfully acted. (Sarah Parish as Beatrice and Damian Lewis as Benedick really stole the show.) It captured the heart of what Shakespeare was trying to say without slavishly adhering to a blow-by-blow presentation of the plot.  This is exactly where the other three adaptations failed. A Midsummer Night's Dream, Macbeth, and Taming of the Shrew all adhered to the originals to the point of making their modern-day plots nonsensical.  The fairies, Oberon and Titania, in Midsummer Night's Dream, were very out of place in a modern theme park, and while I adore Rufus Sewell, his character as well as his counterpart, the irascible Kate, were not convincing in the modern version of Taming of the Shrew. (Not to mention, Kate fell for Petruchio in their first scene together, which undermined the whole point of the story.) I can't even talk about Macbeth. The "Scottish Chef" was so awful, I couldn't finish it.In case anyone believes that it is impossible to adapt a play written 500 years ago, or that these particular plays presented insurmountable difficulties, I'd like to point out that both Macbeth and Taming of the Shrew have been quite nicely adapted in the recent past (Scotland, PA and 10 Things I Hate About You). The fault with Shakespeare Retold lies not with the Bard, but with his brood. </p>

 <p> This modern-day, modern-language retelling of the Macbeth tale startles at first, but quickly becomes riveting and, as it should be, deeply disturbing.  As an American I am unfamiliar with the names of many of the British and Scottish stars, but they are reputed to be among the best and their performances in this Macbeth-retold are professional and compelling.  I am familiar with the talented James McAvoy, whose many credits include the critically-acclaimed films Atonement and The Last King of Scotland, and he is superb here.  I have seen him in many productions, and this is among his best efforts.Candidly, I did not have the opportunity to view the other retold plays but Macbeth alone is worth the purchase or the rental. </p>

 <p> Writers went pretty far afield in adapting some of these productions. The best was MacBeth with excellent acting. A very moody piece that captured the sinister MacBeth so well. Rufus Sewell was a very amusing Petruchio in Taming of the Shrew. One wonders how these super handsome guys like Sewell and George Clooney do so well with comedy.  G Doan </p>

 <p> Although I got this for Richard Armitage's all too brief appearance in Macbeth, the Taming of the Shrew alone is worth the price of the 2-disc set.  The Bard's bawdy battle between the sexes has been cleverly updated but still holds true to the original. I have always admired Shirley Henderson (Frozen) but mistakenly thought of Rufus Sewell  (Cold Comfort Farm) mainly as a pretty face. Boy, was I wrong! His BAFTA nominated performance here is amazing.  It also has a great supporting cast, nice set design and costuming (Kate's wedding dress is a wonder) and the music is fancifully scored.The unsympathetic role of the shrewish Katherine can be difficult to pull off but the diminutive Ms. Henderson reaches out and grabs you by the throat and then tugs at your heartstrings! When Sewell's penniless but swaggering Petruchio shows up fresh from job hunting in Australia (heralded by a didgeridoo leitmotif) and determines he will marry the wealthy spinster politician, the laughs never stop.  I have never seen a more hysterically funny wedding!  Off on their Italian villa honeymoon, Kate is a nasty piece of work and Petruchio gives as good as he gets.  Even in connubial fury, both actors still convey the desire to be loved that we all have.  The black and white montage finale wraps up the whole story in a most amusing group of photos.Briefly to sum up the remaining stories: a trendy nose-to-tail restaurant is the setting for the bloody Macbeth.  It has a great-cast (James McAvoy and Keeley Hawes are the  MacBeths) but somehow murdering Duncan over Michelin stars diminishes the story.  However, head waiter MacDuff (RA) can serve me any meal he wishes, preferably breakfast in bed!  A Midsummer's Night's has a distinguished cast but its humor is too medieval for me.  Much Ado About Nothing is updated to a newsroom locale and some viewers may like it but I was already seduced by the shrew. </p>

 <p> This set includes 4 stories by Shakespeare that have been brilliantly updated.  I was amazed at the way these four stores have been modernized without losing any of their greatness.  You will see:Much Ado About Nothing: the longest and best one of the set, in my opinion.  The setting is a news show and the updated characterizations are spot on.MacBeth: it was hard to understand the dialect but still great story re-telling.Taming of the Shrew: the shortest one and skillfully handled the touchy subject material in modern times as best it could.  As a female, I was impressed with the director for having modern Kate (a politician on the way up) bow to her husband without being a simpering fool.  The storyline is hilarious!A Mid Summer's Night Dream: simply brilliant update of a difficult storyline.  I thought the scene where they all ended up in same spot with little understanding of how they got there was questionable for today's audience but then it's a story of about a Fairy King and Fairy Queen so.....  The updated Pan was one of my favorite characters.All of these shows were well worth viewing.  Whoever thought this one up deserves kudos.  Retelling Shakespeare is a difficult task but one that was handled with amazing skill in this case.  I would even recommend this to help understand the original works of Shakespeare. </p>

 <p> As a lifelong lover of the Bard, and yearly attendee and patron of a Shakespeare festival, I was very wary of purchasing these DVDs and seeing them, but I was especially pleased with these storylines and the production quality.The Taming of the Shrew and Much Ado About Nothing are standouts; each warrant the purchase price of the set.  But MacBeth and A Midsummer Night's Dream are no slackers, either!  The acting is overall superb, the music and lighting and sets very well done, and for once, the chemistry between the leads was flawlessly believable.  The modernization of Shakespeare's language was so well orchestrated, and the parallels between Shakespeare's day and the modern world so well done, I loved these productions.Perhaps not for the overly devout Shakespeare fan who sighs at every missed line or nuance, but I have to give these my highest rating as they are excellent modern versions of Shakespeare's plays. </p>

 <p> I have to say I loved 3 out of the 4. Midsummer night's dream didn't  have the magnificant actors that the others had. Nonetheless, I loved Taming of the Shrew and Macbeth. THose 2 are brilliant. How can you get better than James McAvoy, Richard Armitage, Keely Hawes and Shirley Henderson?you just can't. </p>

 <p> Buy this if only for "The Taming of the Shrew."  All 4 adaptations are brilliantly made for today.  "Shrew" is the best of the lot but the others are great too.  Sewell and Henderson have great chemistry.  "Much Ado about Nothing" is also well done.  "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is good but leaves out the play at the wedding, which is my favorite part of the play.  "MacBeth" is appropriately shot in a gourmet kitchen and stars James MacAvoy and has Richard Armitage.  A must see for any Shakespeare fan.  As always the BBC does a great job. </p>

 <p> This BBC Video of 4 plays stands head and shoulders above numerous of the so-called authentic Shakespearean productions I've had to endure in many years of theatergoing. First of all, it has an integrity forecast in its very title, "Shakespeare Retold." Thus we expect to be and happily are spared those half-baked, clueless productions that set an Elizabethan play with its original language intact, say, in 19th-century Tierra del Fuego, believing that the universal can be achieved through the set and costume designer's contempt for historical particulars.The plays in this DVD set, on the contrary, have all been reconceived and rewritten as contemporary works, sharing to some extent Shakespeare's stories, but not his plots and only glimmers now and again of his grand language. In their own right, they are undeniably entertaining, if ultimately small scale, melodrama or farce. "Macbeth," hewing most closely to its incomparable predecessor, is in my view the finest of the lot. James McAvoy and Keeley Hawes, as an ambitious, future celebrity chef and his enabling wife, turn in ferocious performances which call to mind the best of film noir. Theirs is great acting in melodrama.Teachers may find it useful, by the way, to set this version next to Shakespeare's and have students discern the differences between expert melodrama and sublime high tragedy. Many will quickly see that all the blood and gore that grabs their interest in the melodrama is part and parcel of the Shakespearean work, which probes the characters more deeply and extends their actions beyond private life or minor celebrity, thus transcending its melodramatic origins. Many of them will further conclude - and quite rightly - that great tragic art, far from being genteel, is the melodrama they love, plus. Also to its credit, this modern "Macbeth" eschews ethical pioneering of the sort that blemishes the modern "Much Ado," which has a Hero who's in fact slept with some jerky guy "out of sympathy" before her true love Claudio, here called Claude, comes on the scene. This modern Hero in her ethics reminded me of a student I once taught who declared after reading "Othello" that Desdemona HAD slept with Cassio, but that she'd done so before her engagement to Othello, so the Moor had no reason to be upset. Fortunately, the modern "Macbeth" is free of any ethical pandering. The only absurdity it might lead students to is the question of how many children Lady Macbeth had since Shakespeare's heroine admits she has "given suck" and in the modern version the pathetic/villainous wife and her husband are supplied with a kid who died in infancy. But this sort of literal minded question applied to poetic drama is, of course, much more easily disposed of than the ethically confused decisions of the Othello student or her soulmate, the contemporary Hero. </p>
