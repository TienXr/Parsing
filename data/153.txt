 <p> A bit of a different role for Pierce Brosnan. Taffin is a bit of quandry because not only is he an Irish ruffian, he is an intelligent and complicated man. Good cast, production, and camera work make this one worth at least a rental. When Taffin is called upon by the community to stop a chemical factory from being built, things get uglier than his normal bill collections business. He must enlist those that owe him a favor to fight the thugs sent in to bend the towns people's will. Good quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Live Wire".CA Luster </p>

 <p> It is a well known fact that I am not a great admirer of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. Although he looked handsome enough to be James Bond he never looked tough enough. Much has been made of the fact that although the newest 007 Daniel Craig does not look handsome enough to play the secret agent (some going as far as to call him "ugly") he does look tough enough to play the part.In fact I would say that Brosnan looked tougher in the thriller FOURTH PROTOCOL in the part of the Soviet agent (see my review on that product page) and in this movie (made around the same time as the Forsyth thriller) he managed to convey a certain dangerous quality.In this movie, set in his native Ireland, Brosnan plays a debt collector (Mark Taffin) who when not working is happy to spend his time reading books on philosophy and theory. The movie starts by showing us Taffin collecting on some debts. These opening sequences establish his tough credentials as we see him beat up three men in a restaurant (and in the process demolish the establishments dining room) and go head to head with a barman and getting his way (with the help of a wine glass.) Yes, this guy is a toughie, but not one without a softer side displayed when he gives advice to a group of local youths on how to get even with a crooked car dealer who sold them a `lemon.'Although disapproving of his methods the villagers approach him about saving a local sports field threatened by an access road and then stopping the construction of a chemical plant that was to have been served by the access road. In doing so Taffin must confront a shady Mr. Big-style business figure, his henchmen and an assorted group of corrupt politicians in the pocket of the magnate.This is a very entertaining movie that reminded me of the Mike Figgis movie STORMY MONDAY in its depiction of provincial gang violence. But whereas that movie involved the attempt to foil an American developer (played by Tommy Lee Jones) from intimidating Sting's nightclub character in the English city of Newcastle, this movie is much more rural in its focus and is all the better for it. The characters are well drawn and the cast chosen takes full advantage turning in believable performances.Brosnan's character avoids falling into the trap of being an unsympathetic character. The danger is there since he uses less than honorable tactics involving everything from blackmail to downright violence, but we know that he is fighting on the side of what is right and just so we can forgive him. He is also well drawn as a character and in addition to witnessing his troubles with girlfriend Charlotte, we also see him at home with his mother and brother. Its in these dramatic scenes that Brosnan really shows us why he is such an acclaimed actor. I have a new respect for him after seeing him in this movie.On an interesting side note Brosnan is joined here by Alison Doody as Charlotte, who played the part of a Bond girl in the 007 movie A VIEW TO A KILL. Of course he would go on to play the lead in the series, but here the simply stunningly beautiful Doody shows acting promise that she was not permitted in her minor role as an assassin in the 007 picture. No doubt her performance here played a part in her getting the lead female role in the third Indiana Jones movie the following year. </p>

 <p> Breslin provides the oomph for an unadventurous script and some good fellow-players. The plot is hackneyed, tough guy who has been knocking around the world as a disappointed seminarian, has settled in his home town to be a strong-arm &#34;collector&#34; of debts. When the life of the community seems threatened, he accedes to the plea of his townsmen to do what he has to do to turn back the 'invasion&#34; by Environment Destroying Big Business. There is a strip tease, a lady love, some gangland types, and the usual shady politicians and businessmen. It should prove watchable if not a glowing evening fare. </p>

 <p> I hadn't heard of this 1988 film before, and I'm a Brosnan fan.  This one did not disppoint me--very action packed!  It was set in Pierce Brosnan's native Ireland.  Here he plays Mark Taffin a rather hardcore debt collector, that gets the job done.  He is a loner with a conscience and heart, though.  Taffin gets himself involved with the town's people because of these abilities and they need a person who could go to bat for them against a big business that was going to destroy their beloved sportsfield to make way for a harmful chemical plant.  Pierce was at his best in this action movie.  A great, but obscure movie for Pierce and just plain good entertainment.  If you like action packed films and Bond, you'll like this one. </p>

 <p> That quote is worth at least three stars.This film about a small-time Irish debt collector (enforcer) turned hero in a David v Goliath battle against corrupt land developers is okay, if predictable. The forced intimacy with love interest Alison Doody is probably the worst thing going; the statuesque blonde is something to look at but she was rubbish acting in this. Nice local scenes of Ireland in the late 1980s. Mostly you will be watching Pierce Brosnan, fresh offRemington Steelebut still some years away from his second career apex. I found it interesting to see a pre-Bond Brosnan in a gritty role, as I appreciated when the 007 franchise finally moved in that direction withDaniel Craig.Caught this on cable, so cannot speak to the merits of the fairly ancient (2000) DVD release. </p>

 <p> Of 1987 vintage, anyone who likes Brosnan will want to see it, & it can be had for a reasonable price in that case.  But it is stagey & the inclusion of the the period-mandatory blond (doing a poor job here) quite spoiled it for me.  And also, as mentioned in my title, I was in the middle of the Jack Taylor series when I watched it: by comparison it can't even hold a match to light the candle to hold to Iain Glen's Jack.  Nor can the production values come close.  So take it for what it is, a product of it's time, or don't take it at all. </p>

 <p> CD was in very good condition, but the movie was rediculous!  The acting was awful; probably Pierce Brosnan's worst movie.  None of the characters were believable - just seemed to be going through the motions to collect their money.  I was extremely disappointed as I had expected a much better movie based on the description and reviews.  Can't imagine where the good reviews came from, or maybe I'm just nuts! </p>

 <p> Brosnan did an excellent job considering the story line and his youth.Why do these idiots making films think they have to depend on a stripper to hook the guys.  Wasn't the movie itself good enough?We don't need to see what guys are like - we already know!Story line was good enough to promote a bit of interest - the quest of how he would take out the villians kept the interest -- but the exploiting of women just keeps up -- I ain't seen a nude man yet -- would have to bury him under a pile of sh---- if I did.Ah well, can't keep them all -- I blame hollywood for lousing up some great actors. </p>

 <p> Brosnan is convincing as a man whose life has been derailed by doubt.  He is a searcher for truth who makes his living collecting debts for merchants in a small Irish town.  He places himself between small business owners trying to earn an honest living and those who would take advantage of their helplessness. When a large chemical company, with mob ties and friends high in government, begins construction of a plant which will pollute the environment and ruin the village, the townspeople hire him to fix the problem. He tries to explain that they will find his method of rectifying the situation unpalatable, but they insist that they can live with whatever he does. Interwoven in the plot is his search for truth and order in the chaos of modern life. All in all, this movie is one that can be enjoyed at numerous levels - intellectual, witty, adventurous, and all too real.  You'll watch this one more than once! </p>

 <p> I really really enjoyed it. As a matter of fact if I could re-watch Taffin vs any of Pierce's Bond flicks, I'd take Taffin any day. I am always entertained more by English films (or in this case Irish), than I am by most American films, they just seem more unpredictable because I don't know what to expect. Taffin has Pierce looking really cool (and he still is semi young so more believable as a killer to me), plus the eye candy is not too shabby in this one with some nice topless views that you wont get in a Bond film. Is it full of plot holes? Yeah big time, but Pierce kicks some ass his way and does it in a funny way. Its an American 60's crime flick thats light on the moral dialog, its just the bad corporation and the little townsfolk hiring their gunslinger to protect them. Pierce does it in a very sly way and doesn't resort to the kill until he has to. I see a LOT of low votes on this film on IMDB, they must hate English speaking foreign films (or they're psycho Lazenby Bond lovers out to besmirch all of Pierce's films, lol). Me, I liked the films Pierce did around this time, like Livewire and the Deceivers. I think I've liked most flicks Pierce has been in that I saw (one of those Bond flicks with a bad-guy taking over the internet or something was lame but any Bond flick is good or bad based on the bad guy not so much the Bond), and Taffin had me smiling, it was cool entertainment. Will I be buying the DVD, maybe used, the Arab channel I watched it on had the nudity but bleeped out the profanity, go figure, lol. Looking for a cool, mindless, Irish (!), action flick? Check out Taffin, I'm glad I did! </p>
