 <p> There are so many different options around to invest money and prepare for retirement. It is really quite difficult to choose the most secure plan and retirement strategy, especially in such bad economic situation like today! I found out that this book contains practical and helpful information on how to plan retirement. I like the style of writing, - plain and understandable. I was never good with all those numbers, but after reading this book at least I came up with the amount I need to save for my retirement and what even more important I got the strategy on how to accomplish this task. </p>

 <p> Retirement Planning, Guide to all Important Financial Decisions by Mark Vincent throws reality right smack in your face. It's crazy scary how much it cost to retire. There are just so many variables you don't know about. Your health, lifestyle, inflation, family situation, desires ... are all unknowns you need to be prepared for in &#34;money talk.&#34;Vincent does a nice job bringing important life-money factors to light sooner, not later. Thanks for making me think! </p>

The book is concise and details proven methods for erasing money issues and making smart investment decisions. A useful guide for setting yourself up for a happy, and hopefully early, retirement. </p>

 <p> This book is a great resource when it comes to planning your retirement. A lot of people go into there retirement not being very well prepared. I think that this book is really good in that it mentions things like inflation which a lot of people just don't think about when they are planning retirement. I also like that this book isn't a 500page boring textbook! It is easy to read, and straight to the point! It is really a great guide! </p>

 <p> Very good book on pointing out the right direction in getting the financial education you need. This book is filled with lot's of useful tips and it's organized in a very good way. Don't confuse this for a check-list or an instruction guide to your desires. Here you'll find the right references and the right direction, but it's up to you to learn a lot more before becoming succesful pensioner. </p>
