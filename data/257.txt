 <p> I was hoping to bank in on the horrid cover and back panel as I picked this guy up off the shelves of my local Blockbuster. However, I discovered after about 45 seconds of viewing that this was not going to be a shlock-fest as I'd hoped. However, it did turn into a wonderfully enchanting independent film about a group of people making sense of themselves and of a world that has fallen to pieces around them. The backgrounds of the main characters are slowly unveiled while their journey pushes them forward, following the only thing they can; the voices they hear over radio waves.Again, don't be fooled into thinking that 20 YEARS LATER (should be titled Like Moles, Like Rats) or the tag-line of 'AFTER THE BOMBS. AFTER THE PLAGUES. BEFORE THE UNKNOWN' has anything to do with the movie. It's not Planet of the Apes, it's not Soylent Green, it's not I Am Legend, and it's not Children of Men.Some serious time and love has been put into this film, and it deserves respect. </p>

 <p> I was expecting a bad horror movie but that's not what this movie is at all.  It's ultimately a sweet and hopeful movie about people trying to survive in a world that has been ravaged by war and disease.  There are a few plot points that didn't make a lot of sense to me but overall the acting and scenery were spot on.  The sets were realistic and the scenery was at moments serenely beautiful and at others desolate and lifeless.  I also have to comment on the soundtrack.  The music was wonderful.  If a CD was available, I would definitely buy it.  So, don't let the really bad cover scare you away from a real treat of a movie. </p>

 <p> Bad post-apocalyptic movies and pregnancies are very similar.  They're both slow, deliberate, and excruciating.  For pregnancy, there are drugs - legal drugs - that can dull the pain, and there are procedures that can speed the process.  For horrible movies without a real premise set after a nuclear war, there is no reprieve.When resources are scarce, with water and food nowhere to be found, it's every man for himself.  When Samuel Singleton meets two women squatting in his house - Margaret and Sarah (eight months pregnant) - they decide to take a trip to a spring-fed lake in order to save their lives.  Along with a radio host named Michael, they meet up with a colony of survivors living in a system of caves.  From there it's a bunch of poorly done hocus-pocus amidst a poor attempt at some sort of pseudoThe Road WarriormeetsRaising Arizona, as a character similar to Morgana fromExcaliburattempts to steal the only baby born in the last 15 years.It's slow, disjointed, poorly acted, and tediously irritating.  The dartboard timing of the soundtrack borders on unnerving, like cats screeching while you're reading.  The transitions are abruptly inappropriate, like a cage match breaking out at a kindergarten.  The characters have a noxious combination of preposterous acting talent and the ability to elicit angered contempt from the audience.The plot, characters, and situations are all loosely connected.  Like a drugged spider in a futile attempt to weave a web, there really is no chance at saving the movie or the viewer from the inevitable pain that is sure to be worse than child-birth.  It's just too bad there wasn't a second nuclear war about 15 minutes into this affront to cinema. </p>

 <p> Lame ripoff of several post apocalypse stories.  I saw elements of "Children of Men", "Mad Max", and "The Day After", along with a bunch of forgettable copycat movies usually seen at 2AM on TV, or in the $5 bin at Walmart.  It could've been done much better, but it didn't seem like anybody really had their heart in making it. </p>

 <p> I should have known better after reading the back of this DVD I rented at Blockbuster than to rent it. My hopes that I would be wrong were dashed when I found out this movie is just another poor attempt by bankrupt movie makers to cash in on popular box office hits. Dedicated end-of-times enthusiasts may take this poorly written prediction of the future to heart but, of course, some people will believe anything. Low budget movies like this have the advantage of being filmed in a junk yard. </p>

 <p> Not a bad low budget post apocalyptic movie. I enjoyed it especially because it was filmed in and around Huntsville, Alabama and I recognized a lot of the areas where it was filmed. Yes, I live in Huntsville. FYI, if you're interested other movies filmed here they include: The Ravagers (1979) with Richard Harris, Ernest Borgnine, Art Carney - Space Camp (1986) with Kate Capshaw, Lea Thompson, Kelly Preston - What Waits Below (1983) British production with Timothy Bottoms - Beyond The Stars (1989) with Martin Sheen, Christian Slater, Sharon Stone - Tom and Huck (1995) Disney production with Jonathan Taylor Thomas (Home Improvement television series), Brad Renfro - Constellation (2005) Billy Dee Williams, Zoe Saldana, Leslie Anne Warren, Rae Dawn Chong - A Smile As Big As The Moon (2010) Hallmark Hall of Fame movie with John Corbett - Space Warriors (2013) Hallmark Hall of Fame movie with Dermont Mulroney, Mira Sorvino, Danny Glover - and if you're into Star Trek, the Star Trek 30th Anniversay; One Weekend on Earth was held in Huntsville with all of the origonal cast memebers present as well as many stars of the later television series and Star Trek Enterprise actor, John Billingsley (Dr. Phlox) attended Grissom High School for a time. </p>

 <p> I love post apocalyptic sci-fi movies. Since I am partial to that breed of movie I am willing to forgive a lot. But this movie fails in just about every way a movie can fail. The story is weak, the acting is weak....EVERYTHING is weak. Some movies are so bad (e.g. Plan 9 From Outer Space) that they are entertaining as comedies. Not so here. Just really bad.  I found myself thinking about WORK while watching this. That is how gripping it is. Imagine a bunch of high school film students made a budget movie for their class project. Well, here it is. I am gonna take this one to 1/2 Price Books asap. </p>
