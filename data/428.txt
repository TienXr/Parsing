 <p> The negative reviews must be from jealous people because I found this book to be quite great and I definitely encourage other readers to give this book a chance. It is definitely worth it. The scenes are very sensual and erotic, something expected just by the title. Each story was also different from the next.  Also, each lead character was different, which I am incredibly glad about. I hate reading a series of stories where everything is the same. A lot of the imagery is very strong and helps the story move along quite nicely. Though we stay in scene for a while, each sentence is fresh. So I really can't see what the negative reviewers were seeing. They must need glasses! </p>

 <p> Some short stories are just that ....... short on story line and one is finished before you start, left wondering what it was all about. These short stories are definitely NOT like that. Yes, short in length but long on suspense and storyline feeling like much longer books .......The exciting highlights are very well written. These female authors have written very exciting books </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Shorts .... Yes, but Full on descriptions </p>

 <p> I would rather have read more about the characters. I feel that there was not much develop in the story, and that they were, well, short. Almost too short, at times. </p>

 <p> Not bad . . . </p>

 <p> I almost deleted this little treasure before reading it because of the two 1-star reviews.  I'm glad that I decided to give it a shot because I found the stories steamy and fun.  The first 2 stories were even a little romantic, which I like. I encourage other readers to give it a chance.  They were short stories, about 30 minutes each.  I read all 3 in one sitting and needed a smoke after each one.  Thanks. </p>

 <p> I was pleasantly surprised by this trio of books and had half expected a take off of the awfully written and boring 'Shades of Grey' trilogy. But I was wrong. The 3 short stories are all different and with enough erotic moments to keep me reading right until the end.I particularly liked some of the phrases for example - "If he kissed her, right then and there, and she wasn't into it, he'd be fired on the spot. Hell she'd probably call the cops on his ass. Security at the very least".To sum up, I enjoyed the books, they were not repetitive and each story had different characters and scenes.A good read for those with spare time who like erotica. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> An interesting read </p>
