 <p> My 5.5 year old son loved this so much he brought it into his Kindergarten class. The teacher read parts of this to the class and they were all hooked. This series makes the Greek Gods stories so much easier to understand and for young kids, it's great to introduce them to these myths so young so they understand how some of the modern characters they love were inspired by these stories. </p>

 <p> "Zeus - King of the Gods" tells the creation story in which the titans and the gods battle for supremacy. O'Connor's illustrations convey the power and intensity of this epic clash, and his narrative gives the gods flesh and bone as they struggle like superheroes and tease like siblings.All four volumes of O'Connor's mighty tapestry are freshly appealing to young adult readers. His panels reverberate with passion and fury. O'Connor handles the wanton nature of his characters with delicacy so that alert parents have nothing to fear. At the back of each book, the author's note is like a mini conversation with O'Connor, and the bibliography and geek notes offer a wonderful opportunity for further learning.This series is intelligent, action-packed and a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to future volumes in the series and am hoping that O'Connor makes good on his proposal for a spin-off series of heroes and monsters. </p>

 <p> Originally posted at Fantasy Literature Website for the Fanboy Friday! Comic Book/Graphic Novel Review ColumnOlympians: Zeus: King of the Gods by George O'ConnorIf you are even slightly interested in mythology, you need to order immediately George O'Connor's Olympians Series of graphic novels. The first six books that are out so far are stellar, and though you can read them in any order, it's best to start with Zeus: King of the Gods. Books two through six are best if read in this order: Athena, Hera, Hades, Poseidon, and Aphrodite. I like these so much that I read them once by myself and once with my eight-year-old; I talked my eleven-year-old into reading one of them, and she devoured the rest of them without any more pushing on my part; I talked several parents into getting them for their children; and I strongly recommended to several librarians that they add the set to their collections as soon as they can.These volumes have already become my favorite introductory books to Greek mythology. As an English professor, I've been compelled to seek out good books on mythology over and over again throughout the years as I read novels, plays, and particularly poetry that alludes to these myths. But after reading a poem alluding to Zeus or Athena, every single book I've found on mythology has paled in comparison, as if the gods had been brought down by the deadliest weapon possible &#8212; dry reference books. And I mean DRY reference books, not reference books, because I actually love reference books. But I have never found the reference book on mythology that satisfies me.I remember as a kid I was given books on mythology with pictures &#8212; but I remember these being bland books as well. Bland pictures. Bland information. Now I know there MUST be some great books on mythology out there for kids (and for adults), but I just haven't found them. The books either try to give so much information that the beauty of narrative or poetry is lost or the stories are watered down so much they cease to be of interest to anyone.There are some exceptions, however: I think Rick Riordan has done a good job of making mythology fun and interesting to a younger generation, and he does so without sounding didactic or losing his focus on storytelling, but unlike O&#8217;Connor his books are not focused solely on the gods themselves. While Riordan creates his own fictional characters who interact with the gods, O&#8217;Connor writes solely of the characters from myth.George O'Connor focuses on the gods for several reasons: He does so first for artistic reasons, and I think that&#8217;s why his books are so good. But he also has an educational goal to introduce young people (and even adults) to the Olympians: He includes excellent supplementary material that makes this educational purpose clear. Most importantly, however, he does not water down his story of Zeus. He does not speak down to his audience, but at the same time, he doesn't lose his audience with too much information about Zeus. The best compliment I can give O'Connor's Zeus is that it is simply a great graphic novel with a compelling narrative and beautiful, first-rate art.The writing is as good as the artwork: The storytelling is precise and poetic. I don't know how O'Connor managed to pick out just the right threads of Zeus's story, but he did. When I heard about this book, I assumed the panels would be very text-heavy given the amount of information about Zeus that would need to be conveyed. But the author made a wonderful decision: He focused on telling a coherent story of Zeus and left much out. Anything he felt compelled to discuss but believed would bog down the story, he mentioned in the supplementary material. That method works brilliantly in Zeus and throughout the rest of the books in the series.This supplementary material starts with &#34;An Olympian Family Tree&#34; on the inside cover of the book (which gets more complex with each book). Then in the back are the &#34;G(r)eek Notes,&#34; which give much more detailed information based on page and panel. There's also an important &#34;Author's Note&#34; in the back in which O'Connor explains why he made certain choices about the way he told the story. His notes are extremely important for getting us beyond the initial story, for understanding and enjoying the complexity of mythology. My eight-year-old and I will probably read each story several times more, but eventually, I hope to read him some (or all) of the author's note once he understands the basic story. Only then can he appreciate the subtleties anyway. I look forward to that, so for me, we aren't even close to being finished with these books.For teachers and librarians, the &#34;G(r)eek Notes&#34; and &#34;Author's Note&#34; will be much appreciated, but they will also really like the discussion questions and selective annotated bibliography. Perhaps especially useful are the recommendations given by O'Connor: They are broken down into two sections &#8212; &#34;For Younger Readers&#34; and &#34;For Older Readers.&#34; One of the librarians I showed this section to was particularly excited about having other good books on mythology recommended so that he could order them for the school along with O'Connor's series.Finally, the supplementary material is enhanced by a few one-page artistic pieces showing off the &#34;stars&#34; of the book and listing key information about that key character. In this first volume, we see Zeus, of course, as well as Cyclopes, Metis, and Kronos. These are great pages to look at, and if I taught younger kids, I'd probably want to cut them out and display them on the walls of the classroom. But you'd have to be careful how you did so or the book might fall apart. I wonder if the publisher (First Second) has made these and other related materials available to teachers? I would imagine they'd be in high demand.Even if this book weren&#8217;t well-written, I'd still want to buy the book for the top-notch art. The coloring in particular really makes O'Connor's drawing work for me. However, there is one thing about these books that I don't love: Most of the covers. I don't know exactly why the covers are not favorites of mine, but they just don't work for me. I think that O'Connor's art inside the book really springs to life because there is a contrast between the frequently darkish artwork and the white lines between the panels &#8212; this contrast really makes the art appear crisp. I know that seems to be a small detail, but I cannot find any other explanation for why I love the art inside the book but don't respond as warmly to roughly the same art on the cover. I only mention this minor point because I don&#8217;t want anyone else to not buy the books because of a similar response to the covers.As a forty-three-year-old college professor, I loved reading these books for my own sense of pleasure. And I recommend these books to other adults for their own libraries, even if there are no kids in the house. But if you do have kids in your life with whom you share books, you need to put these books at the top of your purchasing list. Zeus, and the entire Olympians Series, rate an easy five stars. </p>

 <p> Zeus, king of the gods, is one of the most problematic characters in literature.  On the one hand, his origin story makes him incredibly sympathetic and he acts bravely against his tyrannical father; on the other hand, he's an ambitious pretender to the throne who turns around and commits the same crime that his father and grandfather did.  It's easy to say his order is better than what came before him, but it's hard to call it justice.O'Connor does a great job of vividly explaining many of the issues attendant to the Zeus story and the origins of the Titans.  (However, he substitutes a name for a Titan that I have never heard or seen before in any retelling- I had to go back to my reference books to figure out he's referring to the Titan Coeus.)  He also injects a bit of humor into the story, particularly around young Zeus' frolicking with the Oceanids.  It's a little wink to his famous roving eye in later life, and a little poignant because he's most vulnerable with an innocent he'll later betray.Young teenagers and up will enjoy this story and want to read more about the Greek myths. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> Girl walks into my library.  I'm putting her age at around nine, maybe ten.  Asks if I have any books on Ancient Greece.  Turns out the kid is so into Greek mythology that she is willingly learning more about the true history behind that area of the world for her own personal knowledge.  In other words, she is every children's librarian's dream patron.  I show her what we have and then we get to talking about mythology.  She's a huge fan of the "D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths" so we start talking fiction.  Has she read "The Lightning Thief" and other Rick Riordan titles?  Roll of the eyes.  Of course.  Has she read Anne Ursu's Cronus Chronicles starting with "The Shadow Thieves"?  Double roll of the eyes.  All right.  Has she read the brand-spanking new Olympians series coming out via First Second, illustrated by George O'Connor, and reimagined as graphic novels?  Not only had she not heard of it but she was practically clawing my eyes out when I informed her that I didn't have a copy on the shelf at the moment.  Kids love myths.  Kids also love comics.  Put the two together by a guy who actually knows how to turn a crazy myth into a comprehensible, even dramatic story, and you've got a natural pairing that is going to have your patrons, big and small, hungering for more.  Buy in bulk."In the time before time, there was nothing, Kaos.  From out of Kaos came Ge, or Gaea, our Mother Earth."  So begins a tale of how the Titans and, subsequently, the Greek Gods came to be.  The world is formed, and the Titan Kronos eats each of his children as they are born.  However, he misses Zeus, the youngest child, and as a result that particular god is able to grow up, free his siblings, and take arms against the Titans for control of the earth itself.  In an exciting comic book style, George O'Connor accurately depicts the tale of Zeus, leaving off the story to continue with Athena, the next in the series, published as a separate book.  Endmatter includes an Author's Note, G(r)eek Notes as they apply to specific panels and pages, Greek myth character trading card-type pages, a Bibliography, recommended reads, amusing discussion questions (#1: "Zeus's dad tries to eat him.  Has your dad ever tried to eat you?"), and an accurate but complex Olympians Family Tree on the front cover that you'll find yourself poring over again and again.George O'Connor may be best known to some of us as the bloke behind "Journey Into Mohawk Country" and Adam Rapp's "Ball Peen Hammer".  On the picture book side of things, he did "Kapow!" (yet another comic-inspired title, and a popular one in my library at that).  With this book he had one big hurdle to leap: Make the myths logical.  The thing about the Greek myths is that you can read them on paper all you like but some things are just not gonna make a whole lot of sense.  For example, we hear that Hestia has been so long on the stomach of Kronos that she has nearly been digested and barely has a form of her own.  All right, smart guys.  Go illustrate that.  More difficult still is that if you're making these myths into a single concrete understandable story, how do you explain Zeus falling in love with his sister?  The author finds a way, and his words are not without their own rhythm and beauty.  I liked little things, like Rhea feeding her husband a stone baby instead of Zeus and the consequent line, "If Lord Kronos noticed his newborn son had less warmth than the rest, he gave no sign."  On top of that, O'Connor tells the story with a structure that makes sense.  The repeated line that "Mother Earth was still unhappy, for she loved all her children," is what leads to the defeat of the Titans and the rise of the gods on the one hand, and perhaps the eventual destruction of the gods later on down the road.The art is heavily inspired by O'Connor's beloved comic books of yore.  He explains in his Author's Note his love of "The Mighty Thor" as a kid.  "I remember staring at it, trying to comprehend whether I loved it or hated it.  The story was full of all those enormous, bigger-than-life beasts I remembered from my copy of Edith Hamilton's mythology."  If Greek gods are our original superheroes (or super villains) then it's natural to draw them as such.  We've already seen some children's books do this ("The Mighty 12: Superheroes of Greek Myth" by Charles R. Smith, illustrated by P. Craig Russell comes instantly to mind), so it makes a certain amount of sense.  One difference from comic books is the fact that while the men tend to go around shirtless and ripped, the ladies aren't all that busty.  Fair play to O'Connor, then.  And I did enjoy the fact that comic book facts keep working their way into the notes at the end of this book.  We're told that the Adamantine that Kronos's sickle is made out of is where Wolverine in X-Men get his adamantium claws.  Or that the Cyclopes are like Cyclops the X-Men leader.  Actually... thinking about it now, all the comic facts seem to be about X-Men.  I suppose the Wonder Woman facts will have to wait for a later volume in the series when we finally meet the Amazons.The actual art in this book has all kinds of small details as well.  Kronos cut open his father the sky, so his eyes and mouth show only the cosmos.  His wife, Rhea, is also the daughter of the sky and the earth, but her pupils are crescent moons, blue on blue.  Baby Zeus, meanwhile, is raised in a cave and in one panel looks out at the sky.  One cannot help but notice that the stalactites lining the image look like teeth, reminding you of Kronos who has eaten Zeus's kin.  So without a word you are reminded that Zeus has temporarily exchanged one mouth for another.Admittedly, there is zippo racial diversity in the images here.  O'Connor isn't challenging any preconceived notions of what one god or another looks like.  By the end Zeus even has a white beard.  The closest you get to a change is a brown-haired Aphrodite.  I suppose the argument for keeping them white was that Greek gods are generally pretty scummy people, and would you really want to diversify their flaws?  Still, in this day and age it's hard to do an all-white cast for anything, even a children's graphic novel.Greek myths are many things, but child friendly?  I think all of us can remember hearing one myth or another as a child that didn't quite make sense.  Apollo chased a girl to get a kiss and she was so freaked out she asked to be turned into a tree.  Huh?  And how exactly did Zeus turning into a swan lead to Leda giving birth anyway?  And don't even get me started on the changes Disney made to that lamentable "Hercules"!  Hera is Hercules' loving mom?  Puh-leeze.  In this first Olympian title, O'Connor therefore has the unenviable job of telling a story straight without making it, uh, explicit.  Zeus, after all, is the original letch.  So you do see him chasing girls without seeing them get caught.  That's how O'Connor plays it, and it works pretty well.  Admittedly he pokes fun at the material sometimes, and there is a line in "Zeus" that adults will raise an eyebrow at, but kids won't get at all.  At one point Zeus says that as a kid he used to think he could reach into the sky and take the moon.  Metis informs him that Selene, the moon, is much bigger than he is.  His response?  "I don't know... I can grow pretty big."  You don't need to even see Metis's "Heh" in response to get that one.  Accurate characters and personalities.  Still pretty kid-friendly in the end.What I love about this is that not only is O'Connor releasing one book per god, but he's doing it so that the story from one book carries on into the next.  This must have taken a fair bit of wrangling and shifting on his part.  I'm sure O'Connor's natural inclination was to place "Hera" after "Zeus", but for reasons that we will learn soon enough he made "Athena" #2.  It will probably have something to do with the fact that Athena's mother, Metis, has a relatively large role in this book, and that storyline has not been wrapped up yet.When she was quizzing me on this new series, my young patron asked desperately, "I love Hestia.  No one ever pays any attention to Hestia.  Will there be a book about Hestia?"  There will be, I assured her.  There will be a book on each of the twelve gods and kids will be allowed to find their favorites instantly.  Comics aren't for everyone, and there are plenty of folks content with what the D'Aulaires have to offer, but definitely keep an eye out for O'Connor's series just the same.  Exciting, accurate, and intense, it's bound to be instantly beloved of kids, all thanks to its classic comic inspirations.Ages 9 and up. </p>

 <p> The story of the Greek gods is perfectly suited for adaptation to comics. They're all visually interesting--there's the Titans, all rocky and brown creatures that have sprung from the earth, and the Olympians, the fair-skinned and beautiful children of the Titans--and they possess powers and abilities that even the most powerful of superheroes would envy.Plus, the Greek Pantheon has been the inspiration for more than a few superheroes, some more obviously than others. Artist and writer George O'Connor, however, has gone back (way back) to the original source material for his Olympians series. Like all myths, the story has changed substantially in some places throughout the centuries. But O'Connor's painstaking research delves into the more authentic original versions. He begins his series, naturally, with Zeus, king of the gods and the one charged with bringing about the downfall of his own father. The hardest tasks always fall to the youngest chidren, don't they?Zeus is the only one of his siblings not swallowed whole by his father, Cronus. Instead, he is hiden away out of Cronus's sight until he reaches adulthood and begins to be spurred on to war against Cronus by his grandmother, Mother Earth herself. He does as she commands, and in doing so rescues the rest of Cronus's children, and the war between the Olympians and the Titans is waged in full, lasting years.It's a fantastic adventure story, and O'Connor illustrates it beautifully. He also includes several handy texts that help flush out his work here: lineage charts, a guide to the spelling of the names, a history and recommended reading. All of it is extremely useful, for both casual readers and students who wish to learn more.The book does have its share of violence, of course, and subsequent volumes focusing on the rest of the Pantheon no doubt will have much more. It's never too gory, though, and even matters of sexuality and romance are handled quite tamely. That is to say, younger readers will not see much at all to shock their sensibilities, and older readers will be able to take in the clues from the text in order to read between the lines.-- John Hogan </p>

 <p> I don't know if this is the best thing to play with or give to the young and still pure. Zeus was a rapist and assaulter in more than one tale. He was tacked onto the Greek pantheon later, probably by enemies of the more diverse, and at least somewhat, woman-friendly religion. Eventually they made him into the "King" of Gods, a repellent sort of homage to an evil being, but at the beginning he was a minor "god" and some say not a god at all. Of course, none of them are, except in our will and imagination. His worship lowers our spirit and weakens our heart muscle. Predators and rapists should be punished not deified. </p>

 <p> :01 First Second Books is a publisher of graphic novels, including this series on the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece. The author and artist of these books, George O&#8217;Connor, took some of the oldest stories about the gods, and used them as a basis to tell the story of god, giving the reader a good introduction to the deity while delivering a very entertaining story.This book is about Zeus, and like the other books in the series, the illustration work on this one is very good indeed. The story tells of Zeus&#8217;s birth and his subsequent war with the Titans. The book does a great job of presenting the war, with a very interesting take on the Cyclopes and Hekatonchieres. It really does look like a magic war of the gods!This is a great book, perhaps the best of the series! It&#8217;s quite a fun and entertaining book, and is sure to please anyone who wants to read a story filled with gods and monsters and magic and daring do! </p>

 <p> Greek mythology has long been a fertile ground for characters employed by comic book authors and contemporary writers of fantasy novels. So much so that their personal stories as detailed by those ancient Hellenic bards has been obscured for all but academics. Now the tale of the origins of the Greek pantheon and the creation of the earth and the heavens has been re-told in the form of a superbly illustrated graphic novel by artist and storyteller George O'Connor, who accurately draws from primary sources to reveal the same kind of riveting tale that engaged the total attention of appreciative audiences some four millennia past. The first title in what promises to be a four-volume series (subsequent titles will include the background stories of Zeus' wife Hera; his brother Hades, and his daughter Athena), "Olympians, Zeus: King Of The Gods" is enthusiastically recommended reading for its entertainment value alone. The fact that the mythology is so accurate and makes it ideal for community libraries and school (including home schooling) curriculums is a bonus! </p>

 <p> Reason for Reading: I am a huge fan of Greek mythology.This tells the tale of creation from the Greek mythological point of view up to the birth of Zeus. Then it follows Zeus's story, how he battles his father Kronos to become King of the Gods and the founding of the home for the Olympians on Mount Olympus.Fantastic first book in a new ongoing series retelling the Greek myths. The story here is very well represented going right back to the beginning with Gaea, The Cyclopes, The Hekatonchieres and the Titans even before the birth of Zeus. This part of Greek mythology is often confusing to children (I never could understand it as a kid) and the graphic representation, especially of the Titans and the Hekatonchieres with their fifty heads and one hundred hands, is the ideal format for telling this myth. This story is also hardly ever included in children's Greek Myth collections and I've read many such collections over the last 16 years to my children. I feel quite confident in saying the author has done a brilliant job of re-telling Zeus' story in an exciting format. The illustrations are dark and unusual as to fit the subject matter from Kronos and the eating of his children to Zeus' final battle with his father. The book ends with the final destinies of those who came before Zeus and looks forward with a frame of Zeus with his Queen, brothers and sisters, and his children preparing us for the next volume. There is also some extra info at the end with an Author's Note, Fact pages on four characters, a Notes section referenced to pages and panels and finally a further reading section both for younger and older readers. I'm very impressed. This is a keeper for me and I'd highly recommend it as a library purchase. </p>

 <p> Brought to you by OBS reviewer OmarZeus Cover-The comic of Zeus: King of Gods, is the first in a series of eleven volumes. The story starts with the beginning of everything, Kaos. Then, there was Gaea (Mother Earth,) who feeling lonely created Ouranos (The Sky). They married and had children. Their first children were the Titans (Gods of Time,) then the three Cyclopes: beings powerful as storms with one eye. And, finally, the three Hekatonchires who had fifty heads and a hundred hands. Ouranos being vain, locked his monstrous children (Cyclopes and Hekatonchires) in the deepest parts of the earth: The Tartaros.But Mother Earth loved all of her children. With the help of Gaea, the Titans and the youngest one, Kronos, overthrew their father. When Ouranos was cut open by Kronos&#8217; sickle his blood was spilled over Gaea and where this blood touch new life began.  Kronos took as wife his sister, Rhea, and became the Lord of the universe. But like his father, he didn&#8217;t like his younger brothers, and left them in the Tartaros. For this Gaea cursed him:&#8220;As you have overthrown your father, so shall your child overthrow you.&#8221;Because he didn&#8217;t want to surrender his power, he swallowed his first born child, and did the same with the next four. When Rhea was pregnant with her six child, Gaea advised her how to save the child.  When the baby was born, she rapped a rock with the form of a baby and gave it to Kronos, who was too arrogant to notice that the baby was not crying. The baby was taken to the island of Crete, where he was taken care by nymphs and solders and his name was, Zeus.But, from this point on, you have to read the comic to see what happens.The comic series so far has six volumes, and Zeus: King of Gods is the first. This is because Zeus started the Olympians. It was interesting to read and have an image to the beginning of everything. The Titans in my opinion were well described and drawn, I liked how their hair are clouds, and how Gaea made the mountains their thrones.This comic is for the ages of 9-14, which is good if you want to start teaching your children or anyone else about mythology with just not text but illustrations, too. The author gives a glimpse of how Zeus is: determined, strong, and smart. On the next volumes we get to learn about his future children.George O&#8217;Connor, the author of the graphic novel, did a great work of art giving life to the old stories of the Greek gods. He even gave life to Ouranos in the second page, you can see a silhouette of him in the sky. I also liked the Hekatonchires, I have read about them before and had seen drawings of them, but this ones I liked more for the detail their hands with hands in their fingers.I didn&#8217;t know that Metis existed before I read the comic. I also didn&#8217;t know that she was Zeus&#8217;s first Queen, it was quite interesting to learn that.The cover is very good, it shows the glorious Zeus and we can see the Cyclopes and Hekatonchires behind him. The lighting bolt that Zeus has in the cover has a shiny silver finish that stands out from the rest of the print. In fact, all of the covers of the following volumes have some detail in silver that represent the main character. The comic has character profiles for the main character and several others that are important to the story.If you like to know more of the history of the Greek gods I recommend you to read Zeus: King of the Gods and The Olympians graphic novel series. The next volume is Athena. There is always something new to learn of the old stories.*OBS would like to thank the publisher for supplying a free copy of this title in exchange for an honest review*Visit OpenBookSociety dot com for this review and more! </p>

 <p> George O'Connor has done a marvelous job on "Zeus, King of the Gods."  As a matter of fact, his interpretation of the story of Zeus is soo smooth...(how smooth is it?).  It is so smooth that with all the Zeus/Posideon/Hades/Cyclops/Titans mythologies that this book presents it ultimately clear and makes sense of the twisted tales.Mr O'Connors' narration is simple, powerful, and pointed.  The art, I assume by O'Connor, is very clear and cinematic.  Some panels, all you need is the sound of thunder to make them complete.  Coverwise, the lightening bolt held by Zeus shimmers with power!O'Connor presents not only the story of Zeus, but the stories surrounding the imprisonment of the Titans, his brothers and sisters and despise for his father.  Truly, this book reads almost like Hercules except there is not comedic relief!  There is no Phil, nor Meg, but there is duty, sacrifice, honor, and a cosmic style battle that truly cracks the skies!  Did I mention the art is top notch?Being part I of 12, I look forward to the remaining books, Athena, Hera, and Hades.[...]Truly a stylish presentation of the story of Zeus.Long may he rule! </p>

 <p> Written and illustrated by George O'Connor, ZEUS: KING OF THE GODS is the first in a graphic novel series entitled &#34;The Olympians&#34; that tells the story of the ancient Greek gods and their mythology. ZEUS: KING OF THE GODS isn't just an origin story about Zeus. It's also an origin story about the creation of the universe and the world according to the ancient Greeks: from Kaos came Gaea (Mother Earth), from Gaea came Ouranos, and from Ouranos & Gaea came Kronos, and from Kronos came Zeus. ZEUS: KING OF THE GODS explains what happened to Zeus' ancestors, how Zeus freed his siblings, and the war that raged between Zeus and Olympians and the Titans. Although tastefully done, the story doesn't shy away from the violence surrounding the creature of the universe. The story is wonderfully illustrated and lends itself well to the visual medium of a graphic novel. At the end of the book, there is a note from the author, some notes about the text, a few charts about various characters in the story (Cyclopes, Metis, and Kronos), a bibliography, and some study questions. Overall, ZEUS: KING OF THE GODS is a great book that anyone with an interest in Greek mythology is sure to appreciate. </p>
