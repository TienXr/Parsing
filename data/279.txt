 <p> I purchased this once and it didn't play.  said no audio or image.  So I sent for a replacement.  Same thing.  Now I see that there are a few reviews saying the same thing.  They must have sent a bad batch out and Amazon should stop offering this for sale. Shame on the company for having such a bum product. </p>

 <p> Unlike many independent black DVDs out there that are a waste of film and are clearly being thrown together without any real thought put into them, this is a good film & one to watch.  The script is good, the song track is good, of course Clifton Powell the veteran actor is good as well as Crystale Wilson from the Player's Club, and the other unknown but up & coming actors for the most part are also pretty good.  Maybe 2 or 3 of them can use a few more acting classes but they did okay.  As an author who knows a great deal about writing, what I like that Deidre did in this movie besides writing a good script & taking out time to find people who can actually act is that she gave reference & credit to the movie, Player's Club so she didn't come off as a copycat because this movie is similar to the Player's Club from the male stripper perspective rather than the female perspective.  Also, the story line does follow suit with 2 of the strippers using stripping as a means to make money to better their lives in the future just as the stripper character Diamond did in Player's Club. In this movie credit was also given for the name Diamond used in the Player's Club because one of the male strippers stated to another male stripper that the name Diamond used in the Player's Club is the name he should use as a metaphor to show he's using his jewels to sharpen his mind since he is in med school. In closing, the movie was good and Deidre ensured that she gave credit where credit is due and to me that shows she has integrity. </p>

 <p> There are absolutely no redeeming aesthetic qualities in "Shake", if we leave aside the exceptionally good-looking, hard-bodied, virile black men who parade across the screen in various stages of undress. It's still an interesting cultural document on several levels. One is how it demonstrates the process by which the dominate thread in Hip Hop has declined from its early incarnations as fun and as spontaneous forms of social critique and protest by and for young people of color in the cities, into the degenerate mainstay of the culture industries that sustain consumer capitalism and its values among the young of all backgrounds today. "Shake" shares this characteristic with much else, however.What's unique about "Shake" is what is less obvious about it - there's a powerful undercurrent of DL homoeroticism here that's directed toward same-sex oriented black men. This eroticism is disguised by the super-imposition of apparent heterosexuality in the many scenes of near-naked, undulating, highly sexualized and objectified black men. At first glance this movie seems directed toward women, especially black women. Black women are the sex (love?) objects and fans of the male dancers who are the stars and are doting supporters who stand by their men. Beneath the apparent, these female presences serve as excuses, perhaps pretenses that allow the viewer to hone in on the men's bodies, sexuality and sexual performances. They are props to black male sensuality, not as love-interests as in movies that are really geared to female audiences. The context of the film is the world of black male strippers in Atlanta, a world that does exist. Yet anyone even vaguely familiar with this scene and related ones in other cities in black America will be familiar with the heavy patronage from black men who like men in this world. Its particular idioms are substantially different from the world of gay white men, and others who identify with the culture they have created, that now defines most conceptions of male same-sex eroticism in America.This is why the homoeroticism of "Shake" is DL. The issue of Down Low black men cannot be properly examined here. Suffice to say that though it includes those who are closeted and conflicted about their sexuality, it also includes those who are not but who are put off by the feminized, upper-middle class and overwhelmingly white public face of so-called gay culture as it currently exists. Think "Glee", "Will and Grace," "Sex in the City," etc. The specific idioms of Black masculinity is the appeal of this alternative, for which there is no place in gay culture as it now exists. Thus the avoidance of the term "gay" among some black men who will freely acknowledge that other men are their primary object of desire.  "Shake" is an exceptionally bad movie, but even a bad movie can be an interesting cultural document once decoded. </p>

 <p> After reading all the reviews, I purchased this DVD and was looking forward to seeing it. The day it arrived I popped it in the DVD player and nothing, I tried another DVD player  and nothing happened. I thought it was a bad DVD, so I reported it and asked for a replacement. I was ambivalent about the second dvd and I was right to be because it did not work either, not in either DVD player or the laptop. A friend advised me it was a homemade DVD that someone slapped some artwork on to give it the appearance of being authentic. I was and am very disappointed. I am sending them both back. Odd how the disclaimer amazon gives if you are having a problem with the DVD and what to do about it, authentic DVD's don't come with this disclaimer. Amazon save your customers the trouble and stop selling this non-playing dvd. </p>
