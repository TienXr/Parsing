 <p> This DVD is much better than the 25th Anniversary one.  I loved the vintage shorts.  Sony wonder and Sesame Street wonder should bring out a DVD with classic shorts for the adult fans of the show who would love to walk down memory lane.  I love the Music works wonders  in the "for parents" section, but my daughter has yet to warm up to it. It's great to see Gaby and Miles but I miss Snuffy, doesn't he have a song too?  I've seen Bert's doing the pigeon so many times that I can't stand it.  It's on at least 3 of my sesame street dvd's already. Most of the cast isn't there for a grand finale like on the 25th Anniversary edition. Another problem I have is  with the package.  I love that it's a book and my daughter loves to watch the pictures and flip the pages.  However the DVD often slips out  as the case doesn't close properly.  Next time I would like to have the dvd in a secure non-slip case and a nice lyric book for the kids to use.Update 2010I recently purchased another copy of this dvd for my daughter because I wanted the Music Makes Wonders bonus feature.  However when I did purchase the new dvd, I couldn't find that feature on the disc.  The bonus section only has the trivia, cast interview and bonus shorts.  Come on, if you do something, do it right.  I now have to search for the older edition dvd which I originally had.  I am so disapointed in this product. </p>

 <p> I am slightly disappointed as there are not to many songs that kids can sing along too...Opera and blues are not kids friendlyIts ok Something different to mix it up a bit ....Not very educational they dont focus on letters or numbers much </p>

 <p> My 11 month old son just loves this DVD.  He watches at least 2 times a day. He can't get enough of it! I think the program is adorable. The way they put in the cameos from the actual show is very cute.  If your kid loves Sesame Street, they will love this DVD! </p>

 <p> If you have a handful of the other sesame street movies that have a lot of singing I would not reccomend this one because it pretty much repeats all of those songs. If you don't have any or a few of the Sesame Street movies that sing then I would suggest this one. My daughter loves to get up and dance and sing a long with it, and she is 2 1/2. </p>

 <p> This DVD is unbelievable!! My 18 month old daughter loves it and she's been watching it since she was 14 mos. She never gets tired of the songs and the characters. After seeing everyone singing different songs, Super Grover is on a mission to find the one song that will unite the world and so he finds Elmo and Big Bird and they go on a mission to find that one song that everybody can sing. There are so many different types of songs in this DVD from Jazz, rock, opera and r&b to even rap. They are all educational and put a light fun twist on learning and introducing young ones to different types of music. My daughter loves Patti Labelle, loves Denyce Graves and even Queen Latifah. I would recommend this DVD all over again. The skits are funny (numbers vs letters) and Super Grover, Big Bird and even Oscar (yes Oscar) are all hilarious!! Plus it has a eyeful of celebrities.... Parents be warned, you will have a hard time getting those catchy songs out of your head too..lol </p>

 <p> Lots of music. That's the only thing that will keep my 1 year olds attention and she watches this DVD like she's hypnotized. We also love the 25 year celebration. Both have lots of music. I have never heard the ABC's quite like Patty Labelle sings them on this one. I find myself singing along. </p>

 <p> My 14 month old daughter never gets enough of her DVD's featuring music, and this is another one she loves! I'll admit I was a little disappointed when the Dixie Chicks were only in the "Sing a Song" music montage for about 10 seconds (maybe less), but the Queen Latifah, Patti LaBelle, and Wayne Brady segments make up for it!! And she and I both love "Eight Balls of Fur" - we dance like we're crazy and laugh hysterically! This is a keeper. Definitely check out the extra sections with the "Pinball Number Count" (my favorite as a child), and "Captain Vegetable" - that one cracks us up too! Great video!! </p>

 <p> This DVD held the attention of my 21 month old grandson all the way to the end.  My 4 1/2 year old grandson was dancing and singing the song mid-way through until the end. </p>

 <p> My daugther loves this dvd so much and watched it so much that we had to finally change it from the car. All she wanted to do it what it and she started singing the songs very young. It is great being in the car with this DVD. I would recommed buying this. </p>

 <p> Although, like other Sesame Street made-for-sale products, the storyline is a little weak (Super Grover looks for the Song Everyone Can Sing,) this DVD is still great fun.  It's mostly comprised of song clips from the show, including a montage of "Sing,"  Wayne Brady singing "Between" from the 2003 season, "Operatic Lullaby" with Denyce Graves, "Soul Alphabet" with Patti LaBelle, "The Letter O" with Queen Latifah, and "Everybody's Song" with Diana Krall.  Muppet clips include "Do de Rubber Duck," "Doin the Pidgeon," "Eight Balls of Fur," and "You Made Me Love You" with Cookie Monster.Performances on this DVD are terrific: it's great to see SuperGrover crashing his way through the screen again.  If not for the credits, you'd never know Frank Oz isn't a performer -  Cookie and Grover are rock-solid, just like I remember them!  They could have skipped the letters/numbers homage to West Side Story, but otherwise, it's great to see Oscar and Big Bird interact with Elmo and SuperGrover,The extras on this DVD really made it worth buying for this vintage Sesame Street fan, though:  There are four vintage clips in their entirety: "ABC-DEF-GHI," "I Like You," "Captain Vegetable," and, best of all, a montage of the "Pinball Number Count"(same as the song on the 35th anniversary CD.)  I also like the cover - it opens into a board book with lyrics to several songs; a great plus if you have a preschooler! </p>

 <p> The songs are so catchy -- this is a great Sesame Street DVD. I love it! So when my brother had a baby, guess what his baby got? And guess which song is stuck in my brother's head for all of time? ... But what's the NAME of that song? </p>

 <p> This is a very cute movie, and I especially love the packaging, as it comes packaged in a board book with the songs written out.  The story centers on Super Grover trying to find one song the whole world can sing together (good because then everyone will know the words for karaoke...).  Big Bird and Elmo join him in his search.  Some of the great songs include "Between" featuring Wayne Brady, the full version of "Do De Duck" (partial version is in the 25th anniversary DVD), and "What's the Name of that Song?"  The only part that gets somewhat annoying is the West Side Story-like showdown between the letters and numbers, although the "Letter Song" is fantastic, and features most of the muppets.  There are a few songs in there that we could do without, but it is worth buying for the good songs.  Also, the storyline is better written than the 25th anniversary DVD (although that one is slightly better).  This one is a good deal, though, at nearly an hour of viewing time. </p>

 <p> This begins with a long ad.  They made the ad unskippable, un fastforwardable, and turned off skip to menu.That means every time you put this in for your child,  sitting through a an ad waiting for the menu.We like the DVD,  but we don't watch it because of the hassle. </p>
