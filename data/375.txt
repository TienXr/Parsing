<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This moderately entertaining novel is a love letter to the cheesy British Hammer movies of the 1950s and 1960s which brought harmless horror into the lives of the straitlaced English public.An American scriptwriter down on his luck shows up at the seedy country mansion headquarters of Hammer and is given a week to come up with a script. It has to involve a train.Soon, we are deep in Transylvania on board a mysterious and sinister locomotive headed for hell with a bunch of zombie passengers and a small collection of characters, each of whom will be tested to see if they too will face eternal damnation. The main characters are three British cliches and one local Romanian village girl.The author has great fun evoking every classic image of the genre - the clockwork doll that comes to life; the evil insect that bores through flesh; the corpse that rises from its coffin; the scantily-clad heroine gradually losing her undergarments; the vicar clutching his crucifix; the torn-off limbs, skeletal faces and images of loved ones long gone - and many more.It's amusing reading this for a while but it eventually gets a bit tired because we the readers have little reason to empathize with any of the characters. Eventually, the plot like the train runs off the rails and explodes in a welter of metaphysical speculation. An incredibly lame back story set in the studio doesn't help.I put this down as a valiant half-success - nice idea that doesn't quite support a fully-realized novel. </p>

 <p> Synopsis:An American screenwriter is up for a job at Hammer Studio in 1960s England and to prove his talent he must write a new script for the studio. The movie must showcase the studios actors, notably Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, must have the requisite amount of horror, gore, and tantalizingly revealed young women, and must be finished in a week. What follows is the script, starting with its own prologue of a girl in Chelmsk finding an old board game in the attic called "Hell Train." The game depicts a train starting off in her small town which travels from stops with four passengers on a journey through their sins. The story then follows the four passengers and the tests they must face aboard the "Arkangel," a demonic train on a one-way trip to Hell. Each passenger faces mysteries and horrors created to bring out their worst traits. Along the way, the mystery of the train and its unholy passengers is revealed. How can they get off the train and where will it end? But the ultimate question is "Can the train be stopped?"ReviewThe Story:Early on while reading this story, it seemed like there was an awful lot going on in this story that didn't always fit together. First we start with a fascinating look at Hammer Studio in the 60s, just as their decline from the top of the horror film industry is beginning. Then on to this strange interlude with the girl and the board game. Then the game becomes the actual story, set during WWI in Eastern Europe and following an English married couple, a con-artist Londoner, and a peasant girl facing an imminent marriage and the invasion of her town by soldiers. By chance (or is that Fate?) all four end up onboard the "Arkangel," a train that at first seems normal, albeit unlikely, and then slowly reveals itself as demonic. This story is occasionally interrupted by chapters returning to the scriptwriter. The ending, however, begins to tie it all together, where the little girl with the game board is integral to the people on the train and the scriptwriter uncovers his own little mystery.Once I finished the book and began thinking back to the early chapters, more facets became clear. Such as how instructions given to the scriptwriter show up through the story. Or how faithful to old horror movies the story is. And that I could see the characters Lee and Cushing would relish playing. What at first seemed a strange cobbling of different tales became a collection that tells a deeper story about the golden age of horror films. And I love it when books become better each time I think about them.The Writing:I knew the writing would be good, because I'm a fan of Fowler's Bryant and May PCU series and I enjoy his writing a great deal. I was not disappointed. I was drawn into each aspect of the story, even when questioning their relevance, and Fowler does a great job building suspense and then exploding it across the page in a horrific showdown of good and evil.Recommendation:I don't typically read horror as a genre, though some books I enjoy cross over into that genre. I picked up "Hell Train" because I've enjoyed Fowler's other books, and because it was set in WWI, which is a period I've studied. What I was happily surprised to find was a book that went beyond horror and WWI and into the business of movie-making in the 1960s. Having a husband and several friends who are connoisseurs of horror movies, I've seen a number of old Hammer films, and it was fun to envision actors from those films in the roles of characters in the book. I loved the homage paid to the old age of horror, which is still one my favorite periods of films. And I love that I continue to see depth in the book when I think about it even a week after having finished reading it.For horror enthusiasts, especially those who love the old B-movies, I heartily recommend this movie. To anyone with an interest in the film industry of old, this is a fun read. Even WWI enthusiasts will find the setting unique. And if you like trains, well, the train is one of the most fearful characters in this book. Think Maximum Overdrive on rails. Pun intended. </p>

 <p> Fowler's rip-roaring yarn is truly the Hammer film that time (and, sadly, the development executives) forgot, with enough camp to fill Glastonbury Festival, plenty of claret to satisfy the gorehounds, and characters presented in glorious Technicolor. The prose leaps off the page, with rapier-sharp humour (see the description of the Henley housewife's love life) and touching nostalgia (ditto the description of Thorley Walters). Truly a thrill ride! </p>

 <p> It's clear from just the book blurb the author is paying respects to the 60s' era horror films. I can't really speak on whether it succeeded in that, being unfamiliar with them. I can talk about the success of it as a book.The crux of the story revolves around four travelers who are tested by the Devil to see if they can overcome the flaws of their character, with their soul on the line.On top of this is the slow build and atmosphere of train travel on the Old World with a gothic mood so thick you could cut it with a knife, written in a Very English style. The descriptions are excellent, the characters well presented, and the narrative is strong all the way through.Hell Train could have been a five star, but it had certain flaws. For starters the frame story is that of a script writer working on a screenplay for Hammer Films. This frame story is entirely unnecessary and adds nothing to the book except letting you know that the book is a send-up to Hammer and that era (which I can understand but still it does not help the story). The book takes about 80 pages before things actually start getting going, the rest is setup, and some elements of the resolutions don't quite track (I don't think Isabella's test and its ending is all that good).Ultimately the book didn't amaze me, it isn't quite my cup of tea, but to those that like this style or feel that it hits the emulation of hold horror films, this should be a classic to you. Still I'm rather pleased that I found it. </p>

 <p> Hell Train is a horror novel with an interesting twist. It switches from the story of the writer being contracted by Hammer Films in the '60s, to the 'script' of the characters on the train itself. Both angles make this novel not the same old formula horror story.The character of the author is an american who is given an opportunity to write a script for a horror film to be done by legendary horror studio Hammer Films. During this part of the story he meets with such people as Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and other Hammer performers such as Ingrid Pitt are mentioned. The meetings with the producers and others while he is contracted to write the story is clever.The story itself about the Train and the people aboard it and what happens to them and what they must do is the other part of the novel. It is well written and keeps you on edge with such characters of the Conductor and the various other passengers.All in all this novel rises above the general horror, the author definitely shows an appreciation for classic horror as well as skill telling a dark tale.I would read more by this author. </p>

 <p> The year was 1966 and a screenwriter, Shane Carter arrives in Great Britain to attempt to snag a job with the greatest Horror filmmaker of it's day and age, Hammer Films. Shane notices the decay of the studio, but, this is hard times for the industry all over the world.Almost too easily Shane is hired to write an epic in less than five days. For inspiration, Shane searches the library where he is set up and finds an old game board "The Hell Train."The story takes off from that stage to one of the passengers upon the train. Fact mixes with Fantasy. Good versus evil emanates the pages as you read onwards.This was a good old-fashioned horror story. It managed to make me feel uneasy and yet I had to continue reading to find the ending out. Find out the mystery of the Arkangel Train for yourself, but, perhaps in the daytime? </p>

 <p> During World War II card sharp Nicholas Castleford, who is on the run for fraud, ends up on the wrong train, at the wrong time, at the wrong town of Chelmsk, an uncouth town where he discovers the luscious county flower, the blonde Isabella.  As foreign troops close in on Chelmski, Isabella learns she may be mutilated by her husband and his friends so that she won't cheat on him, and so that she won't be raped by the advancing foreign troops.Well, this is the last straw, Isabella decides to decamp the backward Chelmski with the womanizing slick Nick, and in desperation they get on the wrong train, a ghost train called "Arkangel" that only shows up on midnight at Chelmski once per year.  And they aren't the only ones, also getting off the wrong train, and then being forced to get on the Hell Train are the unhappily married Thomas and Miranda Wellesly, a pair who will provide stark contrast to Nicholas and Isabella.Then as the couples realize that they are trapped on the train they can't get off of, the poo does a mighty fine job of hitting the fan as all of the people on the train will be subject to trials that will try their souls from zombies, killer insects, plague, vampires, and (maybe) a personal representative from Satan himself.  There is the realization amongst the survivors that the peasants that populate the train may already be dead, and have to relive their damnation over and over again for eternity.  This is while the living must bet their souls in a game in which Satan forever wins, all in the hope that maybe this time things will be different.This is a story within a story within a story.  The framing fore-story involves American screenwriter Shane Carter, a screenwriter for Roger Corman's AIP films, who, having gotten himself booted from Corman's productions, is now in England trying to get a screenwriting gig from Hammer in its waning heyday during the late sixties.  After getting his interview, he is given the assignment to knock-out a script in three days, and in need of inspiration he picks up an old board game called "Hell Train".  Then he comes up with the second story, a young girl in the small village of Chelsk plays a game called "Hell Train", while her mother is out.  As she plays the game, the train comes alive and grows and roars off of the board, and after it escapes its confinement, the third story, the one involving Nicholas and Isabella kicks in.  It's this episodic story that rocks, and is a proper tribute to Hammer films, and the movieHorror Express: Christopher Lee, one of my favorite Hammer films, in particular.  Although, for horror movie buffs, there is more than a touch of Amicus Productions to structure of this novel.  All the main characters will have to face their character weaknesses in individual stories, and all may fail, although some just might overcome their failure.  I did a lot of speed reading through this part as I just couldn't wait to see what was happening next, it moved like a freight train, and I just couldn't help but wish that somebody would make this part of the novel into a movie.However, it's the fore-story which I have a problem with.  While interesting, it clearly detracts from the better main story, and deserves to be in another novel.  Shane and his lover constantly interrupt the Arkangel segments with their story, and it becomes grating as just as the Arkangel arc really starts on its rampage, it is stopped dead, AGAIN, and the Arkangel narrative is destroyed.  It's almost like watching a ripping good horror flick, and just as everything starts to rock-and-roll, the movie shuts off and we are forced to watch an excerpt from an unrelated soap opera.If Fowler had just remained focused on the old-school pulp horror Arkangel story, this would have easily have been a five star novel, but the Shane Carter framing story just detracts from the Arkangel narrative way too much for this Hammer tribute to earn anything more that four stars.I did like the quote about Christianity ". . . the only lesson he had learned from Christianity was how many slights where remembered and how little was ever forgiven." </p>

 <p> The year is 1966, and a screenwriter from the states travels to Hammer studios in the UK, where he is given 5 days to come up with a new horror script for consideration. So begins the story of the Arkangel, a big, dark, beast of a train that travels through Eastern Europe during the horrors of WWl, collecting souls for harvest. Four rather unlucky passengers will meet on the Arkangel and will be put to the test; a test that will dictate the fate of their lives, and their souls.Hell Train was a change of pace for me, and I'm so glad I picked it up. The story begins with a young girl finding a game in her family home containing a mechanical train and game pieces representing the passengers. In spite of her trepidation, she places the passengers on the train and winds it up. We then join our four main characters on the Arkangel. There is Isabella, a beautiful girl from Chelmsk, eager to get away from her arranged marriage and the increasing darkness of her village, Nicholas, a handsome rogue with a shadowy past, and a vicar and his scheming wife. They will encounter a number of horrors aboard the Arkangel, including a casket with a very nasty inhabitant, killer beetles, a lady in red who is as dangerous as she is beautiful, zombie soldiers, and much more. They'll be forced to confront the darkest parts of their hearts and face their deepest fears if they're to survive the Arkangel's descent into Hell.Christopher Fowler is a pro, and it certainly shows in Hell Train. It's very well plotted, moves along at a breakneck pace (fitting for a book about a Hell Train, yes?), and his references to classic horror and horror greats, such as Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee will make any horror fan smile. Don't be fooled by the somewhat campy cover (which I love, by the way). Hell Train covers some serious and disturbing territory, but the author manages to do so without sacrificing (sorry about the pun) the fun that was ever present in classic horror. There are some gruesome scenes, as well, but you'll have fun cringing (and you will cringe), and rooting for the heroes to escape with their souls intact. Hell Train is a helluva fun ride and not to be missed by horror fans. Even if you don't consider yourself a horror fan, give this one a try. You just may be surprised! </p>

 <p> I've read any number of Fowler's short stories over the years (most of them in a Stephen Jones anthology) but I have to confess, I haven't read one of his novels in a very long time - and if `Hell Train' is anything to go by, I've been sorely missing out!This is the author's first non Bryant & May mystery novel in over a decade, and it's short, fast and fun. As the rear cover blurb says, imagine there was a supernatural chiller that Hammer Films never made - a grand epic produced at the studio's peak. The framing story sees screenwriter Shane, newly arrived in England from the States, commissioned to write a screenplay in four days. And then we're off! Outside of a few brief visits back to Shane and the folks at Hammer, the rest of the book presents a `novelization' of the screenplay he is supposedly writing: that of four passengers meeting on a train journey through Eastern Europe during the First World War. And it is a journey of trials, a journey which seeks to set them tasks which prey upon each of their weaknesses. And as fitting an affectionate tongue-in-cheek homage to the glory days of British horror movies, there are monsters, blood, bared flesh and lots of screaming. All manipulated by the dark machinations of The Conductor. As Kim Newman says on the front cover this is a "... rattling, roaring yarn!"Four years ago Fowler published the short story "Arkangel", set in the Polish town of Chelmsk and featuring the same train, town yokels and others found is this present novel. But `Hell Train' it no mere expansion of that original short story, as it is a complete reimagining. Indeed, the tone is entirely differently and reminded me of the giddy pleasure of reading Guy Adams's recent novel `The World House' (2010). Still, I urge the reader to seek out the original short story, which is played straight and dark; unresolved, enigmatic, disquieting. If `Hell Train' is a noisy cheap beer-fuelled party, "Arkangel" is a single malt on a dark, lonely, stormy night. A reprint of it can be readily found in `The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror 20' (2009) edited by Stephen Jones, whose twenty other great works of short fiction include another terrific train journey story, " `Destination Nihil' by Edmund Bertrand" by Mark Samuels. (Incidentally, volume 19 of Best New Horror also contains another extremely good train story by Fowler, "The Twilight Express".)As recommended as this novel is, Fowler's short story collections - there are 11 of them! - are even more highly recommended, with his most recent one, `Red Gloves' (2011), nominated for the prestigious Bram Stoker Award. </p>

 <p> I am a fan of Fowler's Bryant and May books (although they are sometimes longer than need be), so I thought this would entertain. But I gave up about halfway through. The first three chapters are confusing and like they are from different books. Then when you get to the part on the train things get weird, and not in a good way. Sort of like a Richard Matheson book written on one of his off-days. When I sort of dreaded picking it up again, I knew it was time to move on. </p>

 <p> As a fan of Christopher Fowler I pre-ordered this book, as I do with all his novels.Better known in recent years for his Bryant & May PCU series, he does have a history of writing in the horror genre with a usually nasty twist.This is a straight forward tribute to the now defunct British Hammer Studios & their stable of fabulous actors like Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, who was born to play Dracula.The story starts with a writer hurriedly creating a screen play for the struggling Hammer Studio, about four strangers on a train called the Arkangel, which is racing across Eastern Europe but no one seems sure of where the train is headed.They each have to face their own trial, their own weakness made real in situations that seem to ensure failure.There are plenty of bizarre and nightmare creatures, puzzles and a newly formed romance - all stuff of typical horror movie plots.Fowler can get away with this, as he's such a good writer and the ability to make a past age very real.He obviously had fun with this and anyone who grew up with the Lee & Cushing team, as I did, will enjoy a little nostalgic horror, in the best traditions of the Hammer Horror films. </p>
