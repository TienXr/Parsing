 <p> This book captured my heart with the love of friends and family and a stranger. It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering who did it and who are the bad guys truly after. If you like mystery and romance you will love this book as much as I did. Hoping the author continues this story with the other characters in this book. </p>

 <p> Review of Kidnapped Hearts by Cait Jarrod5/5 StarsIf you like fast paced, full of action and plenty of romance, then this is the book for you. I absolutely loved it! The first thing to catch my eye is the setting, Fredericksburg,Va. That's really close to where I live and I go there often, so it was really neat to read about places I've been to or heard of.Now to the book. It was very well written, and it keeps you guessing all the way to the very last page, and no, you won't be able to figure most of it out. I like that kind of read, keeps me engaged throughout the entire thing. I instantly liked Pamela, what was nice & different about her was how strong she was. Not the typical damsel in distress. And fiery at that. She may have had her week moments within the story, but they were few and far between.Then there is FBI Agent Jake Gibson, retired...*sigh*, yet another fictional boyfriend to add to to my ever-growing list. The poor man has been through hell and back, then it happens all over again. You will also meet a bunch of Pamela's other friends know as the Band of Friends, or BOF for short. They are all like-able and strong. I'm hoping that each and everyone get their own books!The overall plot of the story (without giving away any spoilers) is that someone thinks Pamela has stolen barer bonds, and will do anything and hurt anyone to get them. Then the attacks start and Jake is put on the case to protect her and try to solve the case. To make things more complicated for them, there are people who want Jake dead from a previous undercover case he was on. Now the bad guys know Jakes real identity due to a possible leak inside the FBI.The times, trials and crazy adventures they go through bring Jake and Pamela closer, but can she live and love a man that constantly puts his life on the line, a man that works one of the most dangerous jobs there is? Will he ever escape the people who are after him and will use anything, especially Pamela against him to make him week? I won't tell, you'll have to read to find out. But trust me, this book will not disappoint.There were times I laughed, cried got mad but those are the best books right?! The ones that actually bring you to their world and evoke your emotions? And fear not my friends, the romance & love scenes are so very tastefully written, yet so believable. All in all, yes I would re-read this book, recommend it to friends and I will most certainly read more books (especially if they are a series extended from this book) by this Author.***I was given a free copy of this book for an HONEST review. If it sucked I have no qualms saying so*** </p>

 <p> Lovely story about a small town girl with trust issues getting sucked into an evil international plot. Which leads her into the arms of the so very sexy love interest. Cait does an excellent job pulling us into the story and keeping us there until the end. Loved the story, the suspense, and the romance. </p>

 <p> I always enjoy a well-written cop romance with tough, handsome law enforcers and smart, beautiful women. This one has an intricate plot with several unexpected twists, and I seriously had trouble putting it down! </p>

 <p> Kidnapped Hearts by Cait Jarrod is a rollercoaster ride of action. No sooner do the hero and heroine get out of one jam, than they are stuck in another. There are plenty of bad guys to go around and romance enough to warm your heart.  Pamela Young, owner of The Memory Caf&eacute; has to trust retired FBI agent Jake Gibson who is hired to protect her. But they both have pasts and trust issues. If Jake is retired, I&#8217;d hate to see an active duty agent. This fast-paced read is like the energizer bunny. The suspense just keeps going and going&#8230; </p>

 <p> Cait Jarrod creates a chemistry filled story of small business woman meets FBI agent.  Even though I enjoyed the romance which was sweet and hot at the same time, it was the plot twists that made this read a 'can't put down.'  Can't wait to see more from Cait Jarrod. </p>

 <p> I normally don't read mystery romances but I'm so glad I read this one. Ms. Jarrod kept me on the edge with the intense drama that unfolded, along with the love between the two main characters. Never a dull moment, her sense of humor also shined through with her witty dialogue. A great read! </p>
