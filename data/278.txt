Im excited for some matches but most of them are either released before or the same old wrestlers (Flair, Hogan, Mysterio) </p>

 <p> Watch the dvd before you grade it. It had many great WCW moments. WCW is dead you should be glad that the WWE relase anything from WCW for they don't have to vince owns all the rights. Before you know it they will be releasing the best of TNA IMPACT, if there is enough to make a dvd. </p>

 <p> Saw this, I was expecting a little more considering the amount of video the WWE has in their possession.  Not enough time spent on the nWo and how is fell apart by being too big too quick.  Nothing really at all named about the final days of WCW or the Young Bloods or New Breed whatever they were called vs the Millionaires club.  Maybe a volume 2 and 3 will be made to show this. </p>

 <p> Noone can argue that the mid 1990's were the greatest for professional wrestling. WCW was my favorite company (I was just a kid) But the lighting was better, stage was better, pyro was better, clearly WCW used their money to make the appearcne of the show much better than WWE. Great flashback to the greates time of my life (wrestling wise)The DVD however does miss a few things. Such as the biggest moment in wrestling history...Hulk Hogans heel turn., more of the cruseirwights and such. But it is still a fantastic collection, could easily be a 5 Disc set or even 10. Alot of stuff was left out. </p>

 <p> A great Flashback </p>

 <p> There was always competition between WWE & WCW (and going back even further when it was the NWA) but this was the show that really turned that competition into an all out war...a Monday Night War...that went for 6 years until it finally ended around a decade ago.  The New World Order, luchadors & crusierweights, Four Horsemen, tag teams, metamorphosis of Sting...it's here to revisit in the Best Of Nitro.Now a couple of notes here in that Diamond Dallas Page host the DVD & anyone that's been following the news in regards to this DVD knows that he completely changed the script WWE had for this set to his opinions are honest & direct.  In regards to Chris Benoit, the only footage that is edited in regards to him is during Ric Flair's return to Nitro when Arn Anderson is paying respect to each individual Horsemen member before introducing Flair but past that, he's clearly visible & acknowledged.  The only other footage that is edited (that I caught) is Goldberg being tazered during the "Fingerpoke Of Doom."  You already have a list of all the moments on this DVD set so I'll just review the matches.Matches Include:Brian Pillman vs. Jushin Liger - This was the debut match on WCW Monday Nitro and boy did they know how to kick this show off in style. This was very past paced with the high-flyin' action that you expected that wasn't always pretty (like a botched head scissors off the top rope) but also had a good mix of wrestling with moves like the surfboard/reverse headlock combination by Liger & a DDT off the top rope by Pillman. Great action as you would expect from both men.Sept. 95[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]Hulk Hogan vs. Big Bubba Rogers - This was the first main event of Nitro that went back & forth between both men with the bigger issue being the confrontation with ex-WWE superstar Lex Luger afterwords.Sept. 95Randy Savage & Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Hogan & Savage were running wild early being very dominate including having duel figure fours on both men at one point before the Horsemen were able to regain control & at one point threw Savage over the top rope with such force that he landed underneath the guardrail before cutting the ring off & working over Savage building to the hot tag to Hogan.  This was a fun tag match that would have normally been a main event on a WCW PPV but showcased Bischoff's strategy to put Nitro on the map in that he gave away these types of matches almost every week.Jan. 96WCW Tag Team Champions Match Sting & Lex Luger vs. Road Warriors - The Road Warriors (Legion Of Doom) reunited as a tag team & returned to WCW around a month earlier & right away challenged for the WCW Tag Team Titles setting up this match.  Sting & Luger had their issues with each other as Luger couldn't completely be trusted because of his ways of taking shortcuts to get the victory which was clearly seen between the two partners early on.  Luger targeted Animal's back, that was previously injured & took him out of action for an extended period of time, with various stomps & slams throughout the match before the action went back & forth between both teams with Luger once again getting assistance & taking a shortcut, unwanted by Sting, to get the advantage in what turned out to be a good tag team match.As a side note, this match is more memorable for the power outage that happened during the match which made Eric Bischoff (at the time) go as far as accusing WWE of the power outage in an attempt to sabotage the show just showing how paranoid both companies got turning this period of the Monday Night War.Feb. 96Parking Lot Brawl: Belfast Bruiser vs. Steven Regal - For those who didn't already know, Belfast Bruiser is the wrestler we currently know as Finlay while Regal is the same wrestler we know today as William Regal.  This was one of the most physical feuds in WCW at this time as both men didn't know the meaning of the word "stiff" & just beat the hell out of each other each time they competed against each other leading to this match.  These two used anything & everything they could get their hands on in the parking lot including various weapons like a brick, bumper, tire, seat belt, and guardrail while taking hard bumps such as Finlay putting his foot through a car window & later being on the receiving end of a piledriver on the roof of a car.  A very violent brawl with of course Bobby Heenan having to get the last word in the match that was just typical "Brain."Apr. 96Eddie Guerrero vs. Ric Flair - The previous night at Slamboree, Eddie teamed with Arn Anderson against Flair & Randy Savage in a "Lethal Lottery" match only for Anderson to turn on Guerrero to help Flair get the victory so Eddie was out for revenge here.  They started off wrestling but got very aggressive over time with their exchanging of chops & Eddie bringing a fight to Flair to the point where he attempted to bring a chair into the ring.  Eddie played Flair's own mind games against him by taunting him by going as far as to do his strut on the floor & even applying the figure four on Flair.  Both men traded momentum & was very competitive before Guerrero ended up hurting his leg with a high risk move that led Flair to take advantage as only Flair knows how.  Bobby Heenan described this match perfectly at the end, "Guerrero gave him a fight."May 96WCW Tag Team Champions Sting & Lex Luger vs. Steiner Brothers vs. Harlem Heat - This was a glorified handicap match as both teams had their issues with Harlem Heat causing them to not be able to tag out of the match but definitely delivered a good performance against both teams but this was more about what happened in the end that caused the most unusual finish to a match that anyone had ever seen at that time.June 96Sting & Lex Luger vs. Outsiders - After what happened at the Road Wild PPV days earlier, Sting & Luger wanted a rematch here with them playing their own mind games at the start against Hall & Nash.  Nick Patrick was the referee & just let this them go making this an "unofficial" No Disqualification match as they brawling in the ring & on the floor but it was what happened towards the end of the match that had people begin to question of loyal of not just the wrestlers but also the officials when it came to the New World Order.Aug. 96Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Dean Malenko - The night after Starrcade where both men suffered loses in the crusierweight division, both men were looking to rebound here.  Malenko worked on grounding Rey & working over his back while Mysterio relied on his speed as both men knew each other so well that they were able to keep countering each others holds throughout the match.  This didn't match or top their more famous encounters but still quality.Dec. 96Diamond Dallas Page vs. Mark Starr - Eric Bischoff & Ted Dibiase were doing the commentary here in what was nothing more than a squash match but it was the appearance of Hall & Nash after the match that was the real story here.Jan. 97WCW Cruiserweight Champion Syxx vs. Rey Mysterio Jr. - Nash was in Syxx's corner (referring to him as 6-Pac for the first time on television) as these two had a very fast paced match with Rey delivering a heavy amount of frankensteiners throughout the contest causing Syxx to use the numbers game against Rey.  Earlier in the show, former Horsemen manager James J. Dillion was appointed to the position of WCW Commissioner & made his presence known.Apr. 97WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Lex Luger - This match happened on the 100th episode of "WCW Monday Nitro" and after chasing Hogan for months, Luger got his title shot here. This was a different Hollywood Hogan than usual as he didn't try to stall & avoid Luger but went straight at him & took the fight to Luger. This match was as good as you expected it to be for television with Luger overcoming Hogan & the nWo to finally bring back the WCW Championship to WCW.Aug. 97[Greatest Stars Of The 90's]Diamond Dallas Page vs. Buff Bagwell - This was a nice match but nothing very special past a tease of a confrontation between page & his old acquaintance in Raven.Sept. 97Sting vs. Randy Savage - "Madness" was the definition of Randy Savage at this point of his career because he had no allies in WCW but also alienated himself from all the members of the nWo so he was a man to himself.  These two brawled on the floor right away & kept that mentality as this was just an aggressive fight with both men trading fist & even had the ringside steps get involved here before the issues between WCW & nWo along with the nWo members themselves resulted in all out chaos.Feb. 98WCW Champion Hollywood Hogan vs. Goldberg - This was more about putting Goldberg over as WCW's "superhero" & top star more than anything else as Hogan threw everything he could at Goldberg by either wrestling him & resorting to cheating only for Goldberg to not be effected by it & keep coming back dominating his way to the WCW Championship. With cameos from Dallas Page, Karl Malone, and Curt Hennig...this wasn't much as far as a "match" goes but this was all about making Goldberg the top superstar in WCW.July 98[Monday Night War; History Of The World Heavyweight Championship]WCW Tag Team Champions Kevin Nash & Sting vs. Scott Hall & The Giant - Only two months earlier at Slamboree, Sting was a member of WCW teaming with Giant who had just recently joined nWo Hollywood against Hall & Nash who were nWo Wolfpack members...fast forward only two months later & we have the same four guys in a tag team match but under completely different circumstances.  This match was booked right away after a fight both nWo factions had backstage the point where Sting wasn't even in his ring gear but jeans & a shirt.  This was a fun tag team match that was non-stop action with a hot crowd & both teams trading momentum.July 98Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Chris Jericho - This started off with a bang as Mysterio was jumped by Jericho getting into the ring.  Both took to the air with high risk moves such as a top rope dropkick on Mysterio that knocked him to the floor with the back of his head hitting the railing while Jericho later missed his springboard dropkick that sent him outside to the floor before later being frankensteinered off the apron into the ring.  Jericho also tried at one point a very unique submission that Mike Tenay could only try to describe as an "octopus" & also delivering one hell of a release german suplex that flipped Rey inside out.  This was definitely a great crusierweight match between the two that also continues the setup of Jericho's match going into the next PPV in regards to who counted the final pinfall.Aug. 98WCW Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera vs. Billy Kidman - This was Kidman's first match since leaving Raven's flock complete with him having his clean cut look back after being dirty & scratching himself for a year.  Anyone who remembers the series of matches Kidman & Juvi had throughout the entire year knows that each one was very fast paced & high impact with this being absolutely no exception including various moves & moments such as Kidman delivering a variation of a back suplex that seemed to knock Juvi out for a few moments along with later catching Juvi in midair with a powerbomb while Juvi brought it himself with moves like a release german suplex along with his high flying offense but the ending was a performance that had one talent give the other one a standing ovation.Sept. 98WCW United States Champion Bret Hart vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was the night after Halloween Havoc with DDP coming into this match being very exhausted from his intense match with Goldberg that he showed signs of it from the previous night to the point where at one time Page couldn't apply an armbar correctly so he just went for a pin instead.  They traded momentum here as Bret was more focused on brawling & taking shortcuts than out-wrestling DDP such as doing moves like a low blow.  This was a good match with a very brutal aftermath.Oct. 98Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff - After the screwjob Bischoff did to Flair the previous night at Starrcade, Flair got a rematch with all of his money on the line against Bischoff's job as the WCW President.  This was nothing more than Ric Flair delivering the beating that everyone in WCW (and maybe even other companies) wanted to see Bischoff get for the longest time as Flair was just running on pure emotion to the point where he threw Charles Robinson out of the way just to beat on Bischoff.  The Horsemen were there to make sure we didn't get a repeat of what happened at Starrcade while one superstar who wasn't seen for months also made his return that resulted in so many of the WCW talents (including Tony Schavone himself) having a well deserved celebration.Dec. 98WCW Champion Kevin Nash vs. Hollywood Hogan - This was the INFAMOUS "fingerpoke of doom" where quite frankly the less said the better but it should be noted that the use of the tazer was edited out of this footage.Jan. 99WCW Champion Diamond Dallas Page vs. Sting - Both men began by trading punches with DDP showing heel tenancies such as pulling hair, delivering a low blow & constantly going to floor whenever Sting began to build momentum.  The referee let these men get away with what would usually result in a disqualification resulting in both men brawling on the outside & bouncing each other off the guardrail before Page went after Sting's knee & used the post in the process.  This was a very intense & high impact match here with the crowd being very hot from start to finish with one moment to look out for being Sting giving DDP one of the nastiest looking piledrivers I've seen that made me cringe a little when I saw it.  DDP said after this match that this was one of the best in his career & I can't say I disagree.Apr. 99Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera - This was Eddie's return to the ring after his motorcycle accident earlier in the year with the story of Juventud trying to show respect to Eddie early on only for Eddie to make it clear that he was out for revenge for Juvi & the other luchadors abandoning the Latino World Order (DON'T ASK!) once Eddie was out injured.  Not much of note here except it was very fast paced with Juvi giving Eddie some hard chops that left Eddie's chest red but Guerrero looked like he hadn't lost a step & possibly in the best physical shape of his career.June 99Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, Sting vs. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious, Rick Steiner - Before the match got started, we had a memorable moment in the return of HULK Hogan.  This was more of a preview of the upcoming matches between members of each team coming up at the Road Wild PPV along with getting the tease of the upcoming "Battle Of The Millennium Man" between Goldberg & Sid.  A fun six man tag match overall with Hogan showing that his old self might be back but he has no problems resorting back to his "Hollywood" ways when necessary.Aug. 99Billy Kidman vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was pretty short & sweet with DDP being in a jealous rage over comments Kidman about Kimberly before we saw his anger get the best of him.Aug. 99WCW Championship Match: Bret Hart vs. Goldberg - This match was during the initial "Vince Russo" era of WCW & happened the night after Starrcade where we got that "screwjob" ending in the match between these two resulting in Bret Hart forfeiting the championship & having a rematch here to determine the true champion.  Goldberg showcased early that he had the clear power advantage before both men decided on the same strategy on working on each others legs with Goldberg executing an anklelock while Bret did a figure four.  The big picture though was how everything went down during the match that led to not only a champion to be determined but also "The Band Is Back Together!"Dec. 99WCW Championship Match: Sid Vicious vs. Kevin Nash - Although it wasn't brought up or discussed during the match, this was for WCW Championship that became vacant after Chris Benoit won the WCW Title despite making it clear that he was quitting the company & it should also be noted that Nash was the WCW Commissioner at this time so he banned Sid from using the powerbomb.  As anyone who remembered their series back in the WWE around 5 years earlier got around the same match here in that it was just an average big man match with the match being taken into the front row at one point with later Sid proving the phrase "he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer" wrong as he was able to outsmart everyone towards the end.Jan. 00Steel Cage Match: WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Diamond Dallas Page - The cage used for this match was the regular sized cage but also had a top on it (like WCW did with the War Games matches) while Vince Russo was in Jarrett's corner.  Knowing how personal this feud was between these two (including Page's wife serving him with divorce papers earlier in the show), they started this fight on the outside & went through the crowd with even a trash can being used before making it's way to the cage.  Anyone who remembers the "Russo" era of WCW knows what to expect here as far as run-ins & chaos but it didn't effect what was a good match.Apr. 00Ladder Match: Jung Dragons vs. 3 Count - Former MMA fighter Tank Abott came out to the ring to introduce WCW's resident boy band 3 Count & dance to their music (yes, you read that right) before the Yung Dragons came out to start this match off.  This match was short but still had it's moments like a superplex off the ladder that was on the top rope, an airplane spin with the ladder that knocked out everyone in sight, and Evan's dangerous fall to the floor.  This was the beginning of what many would consider one of the last great feuds of WCW between these six crusierweights as we saw that they would top this match at the upcoming New Blood Rising PPV & months later at Starrcade but this was good for what it was.July 00WCW Champion Booker T. vs. Lance Storm - Lance Storm was only in WCW for a short time here but made one hell of an impact as he became a triple crown champion by capturing all of the singles titles (U.S., Hardcore, Crusierweight) so now he was going for the "Grand Slam" by challenging for the biggest one of them all in the WCW Championship. The match was real short but was a good contest here for what it was if you can get past the distractions like Mike Awesome on commentary doing his "Fat Chick Thriller" gimmick (Don't Ask!).Aug. 00[Rise & Fall Of WCW]Triple Cage War Games Match: WCW Champion Kevin Nash, Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner, Vince Russo vs. Sting, Booker T, Goldberg, Kronik - This wasn't the traditional two ringed War Games match as this match took place in one ring but three different structures as they used the triple layered cage that was seen in the "Ready To Rumble" movie & months earlier at Slamboree.  The World Title was to be hung at the top of the third cage with the object of the match being for someone to climb the three cages & get the belt only to come back down with it & the person who actually walks out of the cage with the title is the champion.  This match had multiple stories being told such as Kevin Nash having issues with Russo (and his own team members) for not only booking this match but stating himself that he wanted to be the World Champion along with Nash's strategy throughout the match only pushing his mentality of being "the smartest man in wrestling", the issues so many had with Vince Russo including one guy who wasn't even legally in the match, the return of a WCW superstar who hadn't been seen in months, and another appearance of a WCW superstar who had his own grudge with Goldberg.  This was a match that was pretty much all over the place but was still very entertaining.Sept. 00Sting vs. Ric Flair - They wrestled on the first Nitro & this was the final match on the last Nitro.  Both men tried going out & having fun which you could clearly see they both exchanged smiles at one point but anyone who watched the Ric Flair documentary knows that he stated that he was out of shape (hence wearing a T-shirt) & neither guy had wrestled in months so they weren't at their best here as we saw at one point that Flair was unable to do his top rope flip.  This wasn't their best encounter but definitely far from the worst but is very important in the history of Nitro for this being the final match in the original WCW.Mar. 01Now I'm not sure what the DVD extras are on the regular version of this set but the extras on the special F.Y.E. edition has a bonus match between Rey Mysterio & Mr. J.L. (Jerry Lynn), DDP's career highlights on Nitro, and DDP talking about the time Sting took him up in the rafters.DDP said it best at the end of this when he made it clear that you couldn't possibly shove 6 years of history into 3 disc & WWE would never be able to come out with a set that makes everyone happy but I still question some of the choices made here as far as memories & matches such as DDP's matches against both Bagwell & Kidman weren't relevant to anything in WCW history so I'm thinking they only put those on here because DDP was hosting the set while I would have also preferred the full Arn Anderson retirement speech instead of the nWo's spoof the next week & maybe even Goldberg's U.S. title win.  Either way they got a bunch of the memories I have from Nitro in moments & matches while having a small amount of repeats that I didn't mind so this is a DVD set to add to the collection. </p>

 <p> A Decade Later...Revisit The Show That Started The "War" </p>

 <p> Generally with WWE releases, it's relatively easy to write a 'pre-review', usually in an honest attempt to warn even just one innocent child away from the latest 3-disc John Cena career retrospective, or to prevent yet another double disc D-X collection of "hilarious skits" from garnering unanimous 5-star reviews.This is different, however; this is 'WCW Monday Nitro', sacred ground for those youngsters who came of age, rasslin'-wise, during the epic Monday night pro wrestling wars. There's no question, Nitro, like Raw, was a streaky, hit-or-miss concept that made one fatal error BEFORE they made all the OTHER fatal errors that brought about their demise.Yes, before the 'Fingerpoke of doom', before the Reign of Russo, and most certainly before the reign of WCW WORLD CHAMPION Vince Russo (not to mention Mr. Courtney Cox), Ted Turner's trusted head honcho Eric Bischoff fell into a paralyzing trap: He decided that the number one company goal was to attempt to embarrass Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation; whenever that backfired, and it often did, he'd simply try to convince viewers through his own commentary and promos that the WWF was garbage, and WCW was the 'cool, hip' place to be. This was in lieu of what SHOULD have been the top priority: giving viewers what they wanted, which, as hard as it is to believe now, was once a McMahon specialty.Bischoff's constant WWF-bashing was bound to backfire; whether he was in babyface or heel mode, at no time did Eric Bischoff himself come off as 'cool or hip'. Meanwhile, over on the USA network, Jim Ross was using his likeability, innate skill, and superior wordsmanship and subtlety to dump on WCW just as much, and fortunately for an undeserving McMahon, no matter how hard the WWF Head tried to make Ross look like a backwater buffoon, JR was just too good at his job. Fortunately, McMahon eventually came to realize how much Ross meant to his company's success, and finally started treating Mr. Ross with the respect he had earned and deserved.....KIDDING!!! Actually, V-Mac forced Ross offscreen for having the bad taste to not be physically attractive enough in the Boss' eyes to CALL MATCHES, replaced him with the bland Michael Cole, and contributed to his own program's creative plummet. (For those unaware, this is NOT a Vince McMahon one time deal: some 10 years ago, he also fired looooong-time, and best-in-the-biz, Howard Finkel from his ring-announcing duties. Gone were the booming introductions that elicited huge pops and seething boos, but in it's place were soft-voiced, uninspiring vocals from the far from gorgeous, but certainly more facially appealing Lillian Garcia. Style 1, Substance 0.)Anyhoo, i tend to agree with some of the other reviewers' comments: stinks theres no Benoit, who had such a strong, if midcard, role for years on Nitro. But that was a no-brainer. It would be nice to see more Malenko, Jericho, Ultimo, Rey, and the rest of the guys who made thier PPV's watchable, at least until the final 2 or 3 main events.But really, who could resist seeing what's been collected on here again? With the exception of just about of all of Disc 3, naturally. So, enjoy. And as always, my little useless public service announcement, delivered only for my personal belief, and meant to offend or inspire nobody: If you must purchase McMahon-related DVD's, or ANYTHING created, manufactured, and sold by WWE, please, go bootleg. The vile, evil, slimebag who owns the company has more than enough of your money. Thank you very much!PS-A reader pointed out to me that by urging folks not to purchase WWE-produced materials (as if anyone's going to take my advice), the only people that really suffer are the wrestlers competing on the DVDs who stand to lose out on royalties. That actually did tug at my heartstrings a little, just because of the amount of work, travel, and bodily harm these guys endured for so long; however, the reader's other admonishment directed at my 'thumbs-up' to black market alternatives fell on deaf ears. While I would love to see the wrestlers and other talent get paid for their work, 99% of my enormous collection is at least 15 years old, and never released. Meaning that the likelihood of so much incredible stuff ever seeing legal daylight is, at best, a toot in the wind. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> It started in September of 1995 and quickly took over the WWE as the king of monday nights in the wrestling world. From bringing in former WWE talent, to the influx of crusierweight wrestlers from all over the world to the New World Order, the highs just seemed to keep coming. Of course eventually there were cracks in the armor and from mid 1999 to the closing in March of 2001 what was once a suprise filled 3 hour show filled with great action and great angles was reduced to being stale, tired and boring.This is a 3-disc set of great moments and matches from WCW's flaghsip show Monday Nitro, hosted by former 3 time WCW World Champion Diamond Dallas Page he doesn't just read from a script here as whenever he appears he gives his honest opnions on what was going on in WCW and the world of wrestling at various times during the sets.Personally I loved the video package they played to begin the disc, brought back some great and not so great memories.Disc 1-The Rise and Takeover-9/4/95, Jushin "Thunder" Liger vs. "Flyin" Brian Pillman: From the Mall of America its the very first match ever on Nitro and despite a few botched moves its a very good contest, though their '92 contest was better. Brian rolls up Liger and pins him. 7/10.-9/4/95, WCW Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Big Bubba: The first main event in Nitro's history and in typical Hogan fashion he sells for Bubba and hits his usual spots including the big boot and leg drop for the win. Average match, 5/10. The face/off between Lex Luger and Hogan afterwards was fun to see, except Luger sounded stupid as always when he cut a promo.-1/8/96, Ric Flair & Arn Anderson vs. Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage: What a star studded main event tag match this is. Its quite good as there's a good face/off between Hogan and Flair and both Anderson and Savage get good spots in. Flair and Arn cut off the ring and wear Savage down before Hogan gets the tag. Hogan hits the leg drop on Arn and pins him. 8/10. The aftermath where The Giant chokeslams both Hogan and Savage is pretty good.-2/5/96, WCW Tag Team Title Match, Sting & Lex Luger (Champions) vs. The Road Warriors: Hawk and Animal returned shortly before this match and didn't look like they had missed a step and the champs weren't far behind them. The match itself isn't bad, lots of power moves from all the guys. There was some underlying tension between Sting & Luger as Lex was using some dirty tactics that Sting didn't approve of. Lex hit Animal with a weight lifting plate and covered Animal to keep the tag titles. 7/10.-4/29/96, Parking Lot Brawl, Belfast Bruiser vs. Lord Steven Regal: Pretty hard hitting match where these two hit each other off of cars with Bruiser even hitting Regal with a bumper and a couple of windows get shattered when Bruiser hits them. Regal hits a piledriver on the roof of the car and pins Bruiser to win the match. This was a very enjoyable contest. 8/10.-5/20/96, Ric Flair vs. Eddie Guerrero: Quite a good contest here, good counter wrestling and Flair made Eddie look great, while Guerrero showed he could hang with a main eventer. Ric locked on the figure four and had to resort to using the ropes and Eddie ended up getting counted down for the three count. Great match, 9/10.-5/27/96, Scott Hall's Nitro Debut: We see Hall come in through the crowd, get in the ring and cut a promo which planted the seeds for the upcoming NWO storyline. Good segment.-6/10/96, Kevin Nash's Nitro Debut: Scott Hall comes down to the announce booth and while Bischoff's back is turned Nash appears and he cuts a promo saying they're prepared to go to war.-6/24/96, Triple Threat Match For The WCW Tag Team Titles, Sting & Lex Luger (Champions) vs. Harlem Heat vs. The Steiner Brothers: Interesting match here, the pistons didn't seem to fire right away but once they did the teams worked well together. This one is more remembered for Hall & Nash coming to ringside and security comes down to protect the WCW wrestlers, but during the chaos Luger gets rolled up by Booker T for the 3 count and Harlem Heat are the new Tag Team champions. 6/10.-7/8/96, The New World Order Takes Over: The night after Bash At The Beach where Hogan, Hall & Nash formed the NWO we hear from Hogan as he talks about how they will take over and destroy WCW.-7/29/96, Backstage Chaos: Jimmy Hart runs to ringside and gets Sting, Savage and Luger to come to the back. We see Hall & Nash beating up wrestlers in the back including Rey Mysterio being thrown head first into a trailer. This actually felt pretty real even for a wrestling show.-8/12/96, Scott Hall & Kevin Nash vs. Sting & Lex Luger: Starts off with Luger taking on both men, then Sting blind sides Nash & Hall and we have more of a brawl than anything else. 6/10. What this is remembered for is the beginning of referee Nick Patrick joining the NWO. The horsemen run down and run the Outsiders off.-8/26/96, Taking Over: We see the final couple of minutes of Sting/Luger vs. McMichael/Benoit, (yes I said Benoit), the NWO comes down and Hogan brands McMichael, Sting and Benoit. The Horsemen come down but they get taken out. Good segment where the fans throw more stuff into the ring and at the NWO.-9/9/96, The Turncoat Sting?: Luger gets called to the back by referee Nick Patrick and we hear from a limo Sting telling Ted DiBiase he needs to take Luger out. Sting appears out of the limo and he and the NWO beat up Luger in the rain.-9/16/96, Vindication: The real Sting appears one night after the War Games match the night before where he was thought to have joined the NWO. He proved he was not a traitor that night and here in the ring he says those who doubted him can stick it. Great segment.-11/18/96, Easy E's Reign Begins: Piper comes out, the crowd goes nuts and he confronts Bischoff. We get the usual ramblings from Roddy and this leads to the NWO coming down and it being revealed that Bischoff is part of the group. Very well done segment.-12/30/96, Rey Mysterio vs. Dean Malenko: A very good rivalry in '96 that continues on the final Nitro of the year. Its short but very good moves by both men. We do seem some actual mat wrestling from Mysterio along with his high flying moves. Dean uses some wear down offense including working on Rey's knee. There was a 10 minute time limit that expired so that match is declared a draw. 7/10.Extras-8/29/96, Rey Mysterio vs. Mr. JL: Good match here, JL is Jerry Lynn (pre-ECW), its quite good given the short time its given. Rey ends up taking this one with a springboard hurricarana. 8/10. A good NWO moment where Hogan, Hall and Nash spray paint the production truck is also shown during the match.-Diamond Dallas Page Monday Nitro Highlights: A montage of his best moments on Nitro, good extra here.-6/9/97, Afraid of Heights: DDP is interviewed where he talks about how Sting saved him and took him up into the rafters. Pretty cool extra here.Disc 2: The Peak and Plateau-1/13/97, DDP vs. Mark Starr: This is a fairly quick squash that sees DDP hit the Diamond Cutter and cover Starr for the win. The aftermath is much better than the match as Hall and Nash come down to recruit DDP to the NWO, but while Nash's back is turned DDP hits Hall with the Diamond Cutter much to the crowds delight. He then ducks and Nash goes out of the ring almost sending a table into the crowd, DDP then celebrates going through the fans as they cheer.-3/3/97, Suspended: Eric Bischoff comes out and cuts a promo talking about how the NWO is the reason they are all here in this arena. Harvey Schiller the president of Turner Sports comes out and after a couple of minutes he suspends Bischoff, which as the crowd going nuts.-3/17/97, From The Rafters: As the Steiners and Harlem Heat are having a match, the entire NWO comes down and destroys all four men. Luger and The Giant come down and clear the ring. Some pyro goes off in the rafters then Sting decends from the ceiling and the crowd goes nuts and I mean nuts. He gets up on the second rope and points his bat at Hogan who looks absolutely terrified.-4/21/97, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Rey Mysterio vs. Syxx: Not a bad one here, Syxx had Nash at ringside and Rey seemed a little more agressive than usual. Rey almost has the title won, when Nash interferes and Jacknifes Rey, Syxx locks on the crossface chicken wing and the ref calls for the bell. 6/10. Post match sees a fan run into the ring and get kicked by Syxx and Rey is carted to the back and put in an ambulance.-8/4/97, WCW Championship Match: Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Lex Luger: Its Hogan vs. the man the NWA and WCW believed could be the next Hogan, Lex Luger. Power for power here, Hogan wears down Luger in the early going with kicks, fists and clotheslines, in fact besides a small flurry by Luger, Hogan dominates the first part of this match, having him pinned down but not out a few times. Luger does kick out of the Hogan leg drop, then makes his comeback, taking out the interfering members of the NWO. He slaps on the Torture Rack and Hogan gives up. Winner and new WCW Champion, Lex Luger. 6/10. The crowd went absolutely nuts for the finish and various WCW stars come out to celebrate with Luger.-9/1/97, The NWO Parody: This was the infamous mockery of Arn Anderson's retirement speech, where the NWO well mainly Nash, Konnan, Syxx and Buff Bagwell mock the Four Horsemen. Its stupid in parts but I found parts of it funny. Being a fan of the Horsemen like I was it was a little much to watch the whole thing.-9/29/97, Buff Bagwell vs. DDP: Pretty decent one here as Bagwell's ego come back to bite him as DDP makes his comeback, Vincent interferes and gets the Diamond Cutter and then one for Bagwell right after, DDP makes the cover and wins. 6/10.-10/27/97, Hulk Hogan vs. DDP: Here we see the final few minutes with Hogan beating up on DDP, but no matter how hard he tries DDP just won't stay down. The NWO runs down and beats up on DDP, Sting makes his way through the crowd and beats up the NWO.-2/2/98, Sting vs. Randy Savage: Pretty good but short match here, with two of the all time greats. Sting takes it to Savage early on before Randy turns it around beating on the Stinger. When Savage actually had Sting down after the elbow drop, Hogan stops the pinfall causing a DQ. 7/10. Luger comes down and runs off Savage, the NWO gets run off and Hogan follows to avoid facing Sting.-3/30/98, 1,004 Holds: Chris Jericho cuts a promo where he talks about how he knows more moves than Dean Malenko. Its an entertaining segment with Chris in his heel stage. Funny stuff.-7/6/98: WCW Championship Match, Hulk Hogan (Champion) vs. Goldberg: With 43,000 plus in the Georgia Dome on hand, this match saw the mega launch of Goldberg as he beat Hogan for the WCW World Title with the spear and jackhammer. Major, major league pop for the finish, though the re-dubbing of the music with Goldberg's WWE music was pretty annoying. 8/10.-7/20/98, WCW Tag Team Championship Match, Kevin Nash & Sting (Champions) vs. Scott Hall & The Giant: Its not a bad tag team match, but this was more about Nash wanting to get his hands on his former best friend Hall. There's a good face/off between Nash and Giant. While Sting has Hall down, Bret Hart interferes, Hall hits the Outsider Edge on Sting from the top rope and he covers Sting to win the tag team titles. 7/10.-8/3/98, Chris Jericho vs. Rey Mysterio: Jericho was the Cruiserweight champion but this was a non-title match, but also a very good one too as these two have rarely had an off match. Rey was in revenge mode as Jericho had injured him several months back and just recently cost him a title shot at Hog Wild. With the referee down and Rey having Jericho pinned, Dean Malenko came down and counted Chris out, so Rey wins. 8/10.-9/14/98, WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match, Juventud Guerrera (Champion) vs. Billy Kidman: This was right after Kidman and everyone else had walked away from Raven, thus disbanding The Flock. Its actually a very good match and shows why fans loved the cruiserweight wrestlers as both men just go all out. Kidman hits the Shooting Star Press to win the title, great match. 9/10.-9/14/98, Ric Flair Returns to WCW: Great emotional segment that saw the return of Ric Flair. Nice promo by Arn Anderson and great promo by Flair. The tension between Flair and Bischoff felt so real mainly cause almost all of it was. There was a major, major, major pop for Flair when he came out to the ring. Best segment on the DVD in my opinion.-10/26/98, United States Championship Match, Bret Hart (Champion) vs. DDP: The night after DDP almost won the world title from Goldberg, he has the chance to beat Hart for the U.S. title. Bret was a lot dirtier in his tactics as he uses the ropes during some submission holds and cheats to gain the advantage. DDP does make a comeback and when Bret misses with a loaded punch, he gets the Diamond Cutter and DDP covers to win the U.S. title. 8/10. Afterwards Bret uses a chair to destroy DDP's leg and he locks on the sharpshooter, Goldberg runs down and Bret leaves.-12/28/98, Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff: For the control of WCW, we have a segment/match, Bischoff tries to leave but the Horsemen (Benoit again included) carry him to the ring and Flair beats up on Eric. The NWO and the Horsemen brawl around the ring, The Giant comes down and goes to chokeslam Flair, but Savage comes to the ring, hits a lowblow on Giant and leaves the ring. Ric slaps on the figure four and Bischoff gives up. 7/10.Disc 3: The Fall and the End-1/4/99, WCW Championship Match, Kevin Nash (Champion) vs. Hulk Hogan: Boy did WCW build this up during the show and during the entrances, it had such a big main event feel. Unfortunately this featured the finger poke of doom, where Hogan barely touched Nash who fell down and Hogan covered him to win the title. Such a waste, but honestly kind of a fun segment, so 7/10 as a segment. Goldberg runs into the arena to get revenge but he gets beaten down and thus began the downfall of WCW. It did get a great reaction from the crowd though.-3/29/99, How To Stop The Spear: In Toronto, Canada, Bret Hart cuts a promo in the ring that has the crowd hanging on his every word. Its a very good, real emotional speech by the Hitman. Goldberg comes down and spears Hart, but he's knocked out, Bret stands up and takes off his jersey to reveal a metal plate. He then tells Bischoff he quits. What a great segment.-4/26/99, WCW Championship Match, DDP (Champion) vs. Sting: This is the definition of a great title match, both guys really bring their A-games and there are plenty of close calls. Sting blocks a Diamond Cutter and hits the Scorpion Death Drop to win the title. 9/10.-6/21/99, Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera: It was Eddie's first match on Nitro since his car accident months back and while not great it was quite good as Eddie was more agressive than normal while he showed very little ring rust and Juvi did get some high spots in as well. Its always great to see Eddie in the ring as his WCW stuff was very underrated by the company. Eddie wins after hitting the frog splash in a good comeback match. 8/10.-8/9/99, Sting, Goldberg & Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious & Rick Steiner: For the first time in over 3 years Hogan returned to the traditional colors of red and yellow, which had the crowd going nuts and thats what this match is most remembered for. Its not a bad six-man tag match, though I don't understand what Rick Steiner is doing with all these main eventers, nothing against him but he doesn't seem to belong here. Hogan, Goldberg and Sting hit their usual moves, Hogan hits Sid and Nash with a chair, Sting locks on the Scorpion Death Lock on Nash and the referee calls for the bell. 7/10.--8/16/99, Billy Kidman vs. DDP: It starts as an interview where at one point Kidman mentions DDP's wife, which brings DDP down to the ring and he starts to beat on Kidman. This turns into a pretty good match as Kidman takes a beating but just won't quit. DDP even had Kidman down but pulls him up before the 3 count a couple of times. DDP goes for the Diamond Cutter but gets rolled up by Kidman for 3 in a bit of a shocking upset. 7/10. Great aftermath where DDP hits the Diamond Cutter on the referee and then on Kidman.-12/20/99, Match For The Vacated WCW Championship, Bill Goldberg vs. Bret Hart: The previous night at Starrcade Bret had suffered a concussion that would lead to the end of his in ring career and while he did well that it was quite obvious that he was a bit off. Good match though that sees Hall and Nash come down and beat Goldberg with baseball bats, soon Bret joins in the beating, Piper comes down to protect Goldberg. Bret covers Goldberg to win the title. 7/10. Jeff Jarrett comes down and hits Piper with the guitar and we see the rebirth of the NWO.-1/24/00, Match For The Vacated WCW Championship, Sid Vicious vs. "Commisioner" Kevin Nash: Power for power here and both men try and the crowd cheers for Sid but its not really that good of a match. Each guy does hit some impressive moves, though Nash wearing Sid down with a sleeper is a bit of a downer in the pacing of the match. Jeff Jarrett interferes but gets knocked out, Sid hits Nash with the guitar and pins him to win the world title. 5/10.-4/10/00, The Bischoff & Russo Era Begins: Everyone on the roster was around the ring, Russo talked about change, Bischoff comes down and does excellent mic work especially when he rips Sting, Luger and Sid. Russo and Bischoff say they're rebooting the company, thus everyone is stripped of their titles. This started the New Blood/Veterans angle that ran for a while. Its a pretty good piece in the history of WCW, though it is quite a long segment.-4/24/00, Steel Cage Match For The WCW Championship, Jeff Jarrett (Champion) vs. DDP: Not a great cage match honestly but not horrible, though there is some nice brawling on the outside before both men enter the cage. There's some good action and some interference by Mike Awesome but Kaynon stops him and DDP covers Jarrett for the win to become a 3-time champion. 6/10.-7/18/00, Six Man Tag Team Ladder Match, 3 Count vs. The Jung Dragons: We open with former MMA fighter Tank Abbott introducing 3 Count who bring a ladder to the ring. Basically the idea is to climb the ladder and get 3 Count's gold record. Its not very long though there are a couple of brutal falls from the ladder, including Shannon Moore getting a huge suplex from Jamie Noble. Evan climbs the ladder gets launched out of the ring, and looks like he wrenches his ankle badly. Jamie climbs the ladder and grabs the gold record to win. 6/10, cause it was so short.-8/7/00, WCW Championship Match, Booker T (Champion) vs. Lance Storm: Horrible commentary by Mike Awesome who had one of the worst gimmicks ever in wrestling history and that covers a lot of ground. This was during Lance's best run in WCW as he had three titles and was going for the big one, but standing in his way was Booker T. Its not a bad match at least Booker and Storm try hard. But its fairly basic as Booker fights out of the Canadian Maple Leaf and hits the Book End to make the cover and retain his title. 6/10.-9/4/00, Triple Cage War Games Match for the WCW Championship, Sting vs. Scott Steiner vs. Kevin Nash vs. Jeff Jarrett vs. Booker T vs. Kronik vs. Goldberg vs. Vince Russo: Every 2 minutes a man comes into the match and honestly I don't know how to call this match. The idea is you have to climb up to the second cage, then the third one, grab the title belt then make it back into the first cage and out the door with the title in hand. Confusing? Somewhat, Sloppy? Yes, Badly booked? Absolutely. It is a tad fun for being a confusing mess, there's some good weapons used, the Harris Brothers also make an appearance on behalf of Vince Russo. Near the end, Goldberg is about to walk out with the title when Bret Hart comes through the crowd and kicks the door in Goldbergs face. Nash walks out with the title in hand along with his buddies, Jarrett, Steiner and Russo. 5/10.-3/26/01, Vince Buys WCW: We get the promo from Vince McMahon on Raw where he announces he has bought WCW, which didn't need to be on here as we already know that he won the war.-3/26/01, Sting vs. Ric Flair: Not their best encounter but it certainly was emotional given that this was the final Nitro ever. They did have some good back and forth action, though Flair was very blown up as he hadn't wrestled in months and he was wrestling with a shirt on which he never did. Sting nails a superplex and locks on the Scorpion Death Lock and Flair gives up. 6/10. When these two hugged and shook hands afterwards it was a very emotional moment.Its certainly some of the best and some of the worst moments and matches from Monday Nitro's history and it was certainly a great time capsule. DDP was also a very refreshing host on this DVD. I think I can safely say this is a worthy purchase for anyone's wrestling library, I know I'm happy I bought it. </p>

 <p> I was always a WWE fan throughout the Monday Night War, but I still watched the replays late at night of Monday Night Nitro to see if I missed anything. It was generally understood that WCW had all the star power and the Monday night shows were always a trainwreck and you never knew what would happen. The wrestling wasn't always so great, but the politics and behind the scenes gossip made the shows news worthy every week. I was glued to the internet every week to see what was happening and who disliked who on the WCW side.This DVD brings back everyone of those memories. By the time disc one was over, I was thinking, "Yeah, I know why I always watched WWE now". Don't get me wrong, WCW had good stuff too. If I was Diamond Dallas Page, I usually stopped to watch. He hosts the DVD and I think he was an excellent choice. I also watched the Ric Flair spots and if Major Gunns was on the screen, I usually stopped. Funny thing, I didn't see any of Major Gunns or the other girls. Toward the end of WCW, the wrestlers each had two or three girls that they hung out with, usually strippers or something they had got on the show. A lot of the segments would be them sitting around in the back and plotting what they would do next with a room full of women. I bet they miss that gravy train.Anyway, by the third disc, the train leaves the tracks and it is the mess I really remember it being. Kevin Nash ended the streak of Goldberg, one of the hottest wrestlers in the industry at the time, and soon after, there was nothing special about WCW at all after that. Once the mmomentum was gone, there was no catching Austin and his crew. Stone Cold was too hot at the time. Goldberg was right with Austin for the longest time, but WCW or Kevin Nash, decided to end it because he was getting too big and they ruined for themselves and everyone else.If you were around for this time in wrestling history, your going to love hearing the horrendous commentary from Schiovone and whoever else. The superstars who did the least they could get by with and we still fell for it for a while, until we caught on, or they just got too lazy for us to buy it any longer. Then the end, when "the powers that be' came in with their internet style booking and tried to let everyone be an insider. Oh, it gets really bad at the end...so bad. But your going to love seeing all this again. Its a fun trip down memory lane. </p>

 <p> When you pick up "The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro", you know that you haven't necessarily bought the typical 3-disc set where the first disc gives a documentary to explain the timeline and back stories of the matches you will see in the set. So it gets a bit confusing to have Diamond Dallas Page give monologues throughout the set about the history of the show as opposed to what a documentary can offer with many points of view over a chronological timeline.I don't want to complain about the match choices too much, but it feels like if you are explaining the very best of Monday Nitro, the first thing you will notice is the omission of the "surprise" appearance of Lex Luger on the debut show, which I felt could have replaced Hulk Hogan v. Big Bubba.  I actually liked seeing the unique moments that happened in Monday Nitro history over the match choices.If the DVD set meant to be "The Very Best of Monday Nitro", then it could have included more moments and fewer matches. Even as someone who started watching NWA/WCW in 1990, I had trouble getting into some of the match choices in the set.  The content is good enough, but I would recommend The Rise and Fall of WCW over The Very Best of Monday Nitro. </p>

 <p> The minute i saw that this was coming out i pre-ordered this set here on amazon and anxiously awaited its arrival in my mailbox on the release date. When i got it i was VERY excited and couldn't wait to begin watching it. But unfortunately, There's FAR too much of the NWO on this set and not enough of guys like Goldberg, Dean Malenko, and Eddie Guerrero. Out of all three discs, The first disc is the most enjoyable since you do get more of a variety of matches and footage out of it then you get out of the other 2 discs. Unfortunately, Other than the CLASSIC match between Sting and Diamond Dallas Page for the WCW world title, a lot of disc 3 is very mediocre [which is expected since it covers 1999-2001 which were the dying days of WCW]. Credit has to go to Diamond Dallas Page for being a unbiased host and telling things the way they were on this set instead of revising things to please WWE like many have done on previous WWE dvd releases. But the main thing that drags this release down more than anything is that almost HALF of the matches on this set are already available on other sets meaning that you will get SEVERAL repeats out of this set!!! I started watching Nitro in 1997 [along with Raw which this show competed against for 6 years] so this set did at least bring back some good memories. Here's what i thought of the matches:Disc 1Brian Pillman [RIP] VS. Jushin LigerThe first match of the set was also the first-ever match in the history of Nitro. Although this doesn't measure up with their classic match from Superbrawl II, This was a nice fast-paced match. ***1/2For the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipChampion Hulk Hogan VS. Big Bubba Rogers [RIP]I'ma say this now: I never really thought much of Hogan as a wrestler but by the time he got to WCW he was WAY over the hill. This was the main event of the first episode of Nitro and this is at least a somewhat tolerable match. Of interest mainly for the return of Lex Luger from WWF after this match ended. **1/2Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage [RIP] VS. Ric Flair and Arn AndersonThis is one of the better WCW Hogan matches i've seen and this is no surprise since every man he's surrounded by in this match is an infinitely better wrestler than him!! Flair and Anderson really make this match worth watching as they attempt their usual heel tactics on Hogan and Savage and the good wrestling that was provided in this match makes this a good tag match. ****For the WCW World Tag Team ChampionshipsChampions Sting and Lex Luger VS. The Road WarriorsThis was a pretty good tag title match and it was nice to see the pre-crow Sting and The Road Warriors. ***1/2Parking Lot BrawlLord Steven Regal VS. Belfast BruiserNOW THIS IS ENTERTAINING!!! With the ring removed and a few cars put in its place, These 2 men put on a good match in this hardcore parking lot brawl!! These 2 guys put on a match that could've rivaled the original ECW in terms of hardcore [look out for the spot where the Bruiser attempts to kick Regal but misses and instead kicks a window of a car completely shattering it!!] and although i don't remember his opponent of this match, Regal was great here and it shows the diversity of Regal's wrestling abilities and it's a shame that Regal never did get a real chance to shine because he would've made a great champion in either WCW or WWE. The only reason i will not rate this match higher than what i'm gonna rate it is because this match definitely needed some blood. ****Ric Flair VS. Eddie Guerrero [RIP]What a great match!!! Matches like this were the reason that Nitro kicked Raw's butt in the ratings for a while!!!! There's plenty of great in-ring action on display here and the late great Eddie Guerrero shows even here that he was such an excellent wrestler that will be missed for many many years. Flair did a pretty well job in this match as well as there were plenty of suspenseful near-falls and good technical wrestling. Fans of either Guerrero or Flair need to see this one!!! ****1/2 [Best Match of disc 1]Triangle match for the WCW World Tag Team ChampionshipsChampions Sting and Lex Luger VS. The Steiner Brothers VS. Harlem HeatI've never really been a big fan of 3 way tag team matches but this was a pretty decent match. ***1/2Sting and Lex Luger VS. Kevin Nash and Scott HallThis was an okay match but nothing special in my opinion. ***Rey Mysterio VS. Dean MalenkoThese two guys NEVER had a bad match and this match was pretty good just like all of the other matches these 2 had in WCW. It's too bad Malenko doesn't get too many matches on this set because he was one hell of a wrestler. ****Disc 2 [I call this the NWO disc because they appear in almost every single match and segment on this disc!]Diamond Dallas Page VS. Mark StarrThis was just a squash match that could've easily been left off of this set [but they could've instead just left in the aftermath of the match where the NWO attempted to recruit DDP]. **For the WCW Cruiserweight ChampionshipChampion Syxx VS. Rey MysterioA pretty good fast-paced cruiserweight match marred only by the presence of the NWO. ***1/2For the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipChampion Hollywood Hogan VS. Lex LugerNot really a good match as i'm not really much of a fan of either of these guys. I guess it was okay for a tv match. **1/2Diamond Dallas Page VS. Buff BagwellThis was just an average match. It was nice to see Raven though [why wasn't any of his segments with the flock included in this set????????????]. **1/2Sting VS. Randy Savage [RIP]A pretty good match here. Interestingly, The Macho Man was in a no man's land as he was neither on WCW's or the NWO's side any longer so that meant he had nobody to trust anymore. This match was pretty good for what it was. ***1/2For the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipChampion Hollywood Hogan VS. GoldbergSomewhat of an overrated match, This match was watchable mainly due to the audience. Keep in mind that neither of these guys were great wrestlers [although both were entertaining] so you're not gonna see great technical moves or anything like that. I must say that this match was a missed opportunity for WCW as they could've made MILLIONS if this match was saved for Starrcade 98. Instead, in true Bischoff fashion, This match was allowed to main event an episode of Nitro in an attempt to defeat Raw again for the week [by this time the attitude era was under way in the WWF and they made a comeback in the ratings against WCW]. This match did earn Nitro higher ratings than Raw for the week it aired but it was an average match at best. **1/2For the WCW World Tag Team ChampionshipsChampions Kevin Nash and Sting VS. Scott Hall and The GiantThis was another average tag title match. ***Rey Mysterio VS. Chris JerichoI liked this match. Nitro was a good show partly because of the excellent action that the cruiserweights provided throughout. If you like either of these guys you'll like this match. ****For the WCW Cruiserweight ChampionshipChampion Juventud Guerrera VS. Billy KidmanI was happy to see another cruiserweight match and boy was this a great one!!! Lots of aerial action were put on display from these two and there was never a dull moment in this match. The story here was that Billy Kidman [along with the other members of the flock] abandoned Raven the night before this match and this was Kidman's first match outside of the flock and this is where he won his first cruiserweight title. This is a great example of just how essential the cruiserweights were to WCW. ****1/2 [best match on disc 2]For the WCW U.S. ChampionshipChampion Bret Hart VS. Diamond Dallas PageThis was a decent match especially when you take into consideration how lackluster Bret's WCW stint really was. ***Ric Flair VS. Eric BischoffI know this was a hot feud in 98 but this match could've really been left off as this match is just a terrible squash match. *Disc 3For the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipChampion Kevin Nash VS. Hollywood HoganThis is the infamous Fingerpoke Of Doom. In terms of wrestling this was absolutely nothing but in terms of sheer comedy, this is still the funniest moment in all of wrestling history!!!!! Sure stuff like this played a large role in the downfall of WCW but i'm willing to bet that you laughed at least once when you saw this!!!! ***** [FOR COMEDIC PURPOSES ONLY]For the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipChampion Diamond Dallas Page VS. StingEXCELLENT MATCH!! Although this match happened when WCW was beginning to fall, You can't deny that this was one hell of a match!!! Sting and DDP put on excellent performances throughout and they both make this match a bonafide classic!! This was one of the best matches in Nitro history and i'm very greatful that this was included in this set and in my opinion, this was the best match of the entire set [even if it is on the worst disc]. This was a pay-per-view caliber title match and i would have to say that both of these men really tore the house down in this match as the crowd was really into it!!! Sure there were even better matches than this on Nitro throughout the years but for what was included on this set, It doesn't get any better than this right here!!!! This was DDP's best match of all time and this match stands as a testament to how great of a wrestler Sting really was back then. This match alone is worth the price of this set!!! ***** [best match on disc 3 and the best match of the entire set]Eddie Guerrero [RIP] VS. Juventud GuerreraThis was Guerrero's first match back since an unfortunate accident he suffered earlier in 1999 and he puts on a good performance against Juventud here. ***1/2Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, and Sting VS. Kevin Nash, Sid Vicious, and Rick SteinerAn okay 6 man tag which sees the return of the red and yellow Hulk Hogan. The match is nothing special but it's worth a watch. ***Diamond Dallas Page VS. Billy KidmanThis was an impromptu match which started because of the fact that DDP [who was by now a heel] overheard Kidman's opinion on his then-wife Kimberly which infuriated DDP and lead to DDP attacking Kidman. This was an alright match. ***For the vacant WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipBret Hart VS. GoldbergOn the night after Starrcade 99 Bret and Goldberg wrestled to determine who was the real WCW champion after Bret forfeited the title 24 hours earlier. This was not that good of a match and this match is notable for the reunion of the NWO. **1/2For the vacant WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipSid Vicious VS. Kevin NashAs the WCW commissioner, Kevin Nash banned Sid Vicious from using the powerbomb which was designed to make this even more of a challenge for Sid. This was nothing but another big man's match and this could be skipped. **Steel Cage Match for the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipChampion Jeff Jarrett VS. Diamond Dallas PageThis painfully average cage match took place in the height of the Russo era and this is not a good match despite the talent involved. **Ladder MatchJung Dragons VS. 3 CountAlthough this took place during a horrible time in WCW's history this match was pretty good as all six of these guys gave it their all despite the little time that was put aside for this match. This doesn't compare to the ladder matches WWF was having with Edge and Christian and The Hardy's but it's a fun little match. ***For the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipChampion Booker T VS. Lance StormBooker was a great wrestler in WCW and more of his matches deserved to be on this set but oh well i guess this is all Vince wanted to show of Booker's matches in this set. Lance Storm actually had a pretty worthy stint in WCW as he once held the U.S., Hardcore, and Cruiserweight titles simultaneously and when this match took place Lance was considered a worthy challenger to Booker's WCW championship. This was a pretty good match that unfortunately was marred somewhat by the totally unnecessary ringside antics of Mike Awesome [during his dreadful fat chick thriller gimmick] . If you can put up with the stupid stuff Mike Awesome and some fat girl do at the announcer's desk, you'll find yourself enjoying this match but this match is also a good example of how stupid WCW had gotten. ***1/2Triple cage war games match for the WCW World Heavyweight ChampionshipThis match included then WCW champion Kevin Nash, Jeff Jarrett, Sting, Goldberg, Booker T, and several others in a match where the object was to climb the three cages and capture the WCW championship which was in the third cage and then go all the way back down and walk outside the cage with the belt. There was FAR too many things going on in this match making this a pain to watch. **Sting VS. Ric FlairThis was the main event of the final episode of Nitro and in that aspect this is a historical match but is it a good match? Ultimately, no. It's not a terrible match but these two guys have had much better matches against each other over the years and this simply doesn't even begin to measure up to the classics these 2 had in the late 80's-early 90's. **1/2There you have it. This set definitely could've used some more cruiserweight matches and could've shown more guys like Raven, La Parka, and Konnan. Unfortunately Chris Benoit doesn't get any matches on this set due to the infamous murder-suicide he committed back in 2007 [although he's seen on the Four Horsemen reunion segment]. This doesn't even BEGIN to show the best of Nitro as its loaded with a few too many needless segments and not enough great matches but this is worth the purchase for the classic match between Sting and DDP.  Since this dvd was obviously a successful release i can only hope that WWE decides to do a volume 2 of this set [and maybe even a best of Thunder set]. </p>

 <p> Disc 1:Flyin' Brian Pillman vs. Jushin Thunder Liger4th September, 1995Significant because it was the very first match ever featured on Nitro.  Pretty good back on forth action for the time.  Not too much to elaborate on.  6/10Hulk Hogan vs. Big Bubba Rogers4th September, 1995Like the match above, this was featured simply because it was the first main event on Nitro.  This was a very typical mid 90's Hogan match.  Big Bubba was noticeably overweight and seemed to get winded quickly.  It was a fun watch, with the crowd coming alive when Hogan began his traditional antics at the end.  The post match was a fun watch too with the Hogan - Luger confrontation.  5.5/10"Macho Man" Randy Savage & Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson8th January, 1996This match was a definite step up from the previous two.  It had the fun element to watch, but also all four men really seemed to put in a good effort here.  Really good match here from all four.  7/10WCW World Tag Team Championship MatchSting and Lex Luger vs. The Road Warriors5th February, 1996Solid match here.  Warriors were a little stiff and slow and the two teams seemed to have a bit of trouble clicking at times.  Towards the last couple of minutes they seemed to find their rythm.  5.75/10Parking Lot BrawlLord Steven Regal vs. Belfast Bruiser29th April, 1996The word "brawl" in the title is used literally here.  This is two stiff, great wrestlers beating each other down on top of cars in a parking lot.  The first half of the match is alot of back and forth hard, stiff brawling, but the second half really incorporates some good spots.  Some really cool suplexes, slams, and elbow drops on cards.  6.5/10Eddie Guerrero vs. Ric Flair20th May, 1996I really enjoyed this match.  It's pretty much self explanatory.  Two great wrestlers, Flair still in great condition vs a young and quick Eddie.  Good action and nice psychology by two good ones.  7/10WCW World Tag Team Championship Triangle MatchSting & Lex Luger vs. The Steiner Brother vs. Harlem Heat24th June, 1996This three-way was an excellent step up from the previous Sting & Luger vs Road Warriors match previously featured.  This was a really good showing.  Fast paced action from all three teams.  This is one of the reasons I love the DVD so much, hidden gems like this that you would otherwise forget about forever.  7.5/10Sting & Lex Luger vs. The Outsiders Scott Hall & Kevin Nash12th August, 1996Pretty good showing here, but rather short.  A match of this caliber was a really big deal on Nitro at the time, though it was really just used to advance the budding nWo vs WCW storyline.  6.5/10Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. Dean Malenko30th December, 1996Good match here, similiar to the Flair vs Eddie match from earlier.  WCW was known for great showings from their strong midcard wrestlers and cruiserweights, this was no exception.  7/10There were quite a few great segments on Disc one featuring the nWo, WCW, Hall, Nash, Sting, "Sting", Luger, and Bischoff.  I chose not to review them all, but they are all 100% great.  They brought back so many fun memories of watching Nitro, but on top of that they are really well done.  10/10 for all segments.Disc 2:Diamond Dallas Page vs. Mark Starr13th January, 1997The match is really nothing, lasting all of 3 minutes.  It was fun to watch a young DDP again.  The crowd hangs on his every move.  The post match is awesome, with Hall and Nash coming out to confront DDP about joining the nWo.  It was things like this that really made you want to tune into Nitro every Monday night and made that WCW vs nWo feud so great.  8/10WCW Cruiserweight Championship MatchSyxx vs. Rey Mysterio Jr.21st April, 1997Excellent match.  Rey has always been great, but I forgot how quick and agile he used to be in the early days.  Syxx really showed up here also.  I forgot that he was once a great worker.  Fun interference by Nash.  Great WCW vs nWo stuff.  8/10WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchHollywood Hulk Hogan vs. Lex Luger4th August, 1997This was a huge deal at the time.  Luger vs Hogan for free on the main event of Nitro.  This was a typical WCW veteran main event match from the time, which wasn't a bad thing.  Great crowd participation.  For what these two lacked in "technical ability", they made up for with the fun factor in this match.  Good stuff.  7/10Diamond Dallas Page vs. Buff Bagwell29th September, 1997Good effort and match by both guys in this match.  Mid-Nitro matches like this that are easily forgotten is what makes this DVD great.  Bagwell was always a bit underrated and this showing with the hard working DDP shows why.  6.5/10Sting vs. "Macho Man" Randy Savage2nd February, 1998It's shorter than it should be for a billing of this caliber on the main event of Nitro, but it is great for the length that it lasted.  The crowd is super hot for this big time clash.  Lots of interference in this wild match towards the end.  Macho and Sting went really hard for the time they were alloted.  8.5/10WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchHollywood Hulk Hogan vs. Goldberg6th July, 1998Awesome stuff for the time.  Like the Luger vs Hogan match, for what it lacked in "technica expertise" it more than made up for in "it" factor.  Absolute loudest and hottest crowd there may have ever been at a wrestling event.  When Goldberg gains momentum towards the end, they grow louder and louder and eventually reach a frenzy at the end.  The final two minutes is worth the watch of the whole match.  8/10WCW World Tag Team Championship MatchKevin Nash & Sting vs. Scott Hall & The Giant20th July, 1998Another hot crowd with four guys that had the "it" factor.  Common thing here with these big time WCW matches - just fun with guys who are good at what they do.  Good action back and forth.  7/10WCW Cruiserweight Championship MatchJuventud Guerrera vs. Billy Kidman14th September, 1998This is 100% what the WCW cruiserweight division was all about!  Fantastic match.  Crowd ate it up.  These two guys were really talented and this match let them shine.  They really did a good job pacing too, as this match gets bigger and faster as it goes on.  9/10Ric Flair Returns to the Four Horsemen14th September, 1998I'm not reviewing specific segments, but this one is too great not to at least mention.  Unbelievable emotions shown, crowd that is going nuts, excellent promos all around.  Crazy good.  10/10WCW United States Championship MatchBret "Hitman" Hart vs. Diamond Dallas Page26th October, 1998Bret is obviously an all time great and DDP always worked with everything he had.  Really solid match here with somewhat of a surprise ending.  8.25/10Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff28th December, 1998Short and Sweet.  Really more of a segment than a match.  Good, fun stuff though.  Tons of wrestlers make appearances in this one.  Once again, hot crowd.  8/10Segments:  Once again there were a few segments with the nWo, Jericho, Sting, etc. that I did not review.  They are all great and always worth a look.  10/10Disc 3:WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchKevin Nash vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan4th January, 1999This is 98% segment and 2% match.  The atmosphere around it is huge though and the crowd is going nuts.  It is a fun reminder of how huge a potential matchup like this was.  Bear in mind I'm reviewing this as a segment:  8.5/10Goldberg Spears The Hitman29th March, 1999Another segment I am reviewing.  This is great, maybe my favorite segment of the DVD.  Bret cuts a 7 minute promo, which may be the best of his career.  As he looks at the camera, you are literally hanging on to every word he speaks.  The Canadian crowd can not get enough of anything Bret does.  Goldberg finally comes out for a VERY climactic ending.  10/10WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchSting vs. Diamond Dallas Page26th April, 1999In my opinion, this is the best match on the entire three disc set.  This could be the best match of DDP's career.  Sting and DDP went all out for around 14 minutes.  They went as hard as they could and had some really awesome false finishes and ring psychology.  10/10Eddie Guerrero vs. Juventud Guerrera21st June, 1999This match was a bit of a disappointment.  This significance of this match on this DVD is that this was Eddie's return match from his near-career ending car wreck.  Eddie showed no rust and Juvi is always great, but these two just seemed to have a bit of trouble clicking at moments.  5.5/10Hulk Hogan & Goldberg & Sting vs. Kevin Nash & Sid Vicious & Rick Steiner9th August, 1999Good stuff, fun match.  It had been over three years, but Hogan finally returned to the red and yellow.  That's why this match if featured on this DVD.  From a historical standpoint, it should have been bigger than it was, but WCW was starting to fade in ratings at this point, so it wasn't quite built up like it needed to be.  The match is good stuff though.  The faces dominate the majority of the match.  They hit their big moves and the crowd likes it.  Good trip down memory lane.  7/10Billy Kidman vs. Diamond Dallas Page16th August, 1999What starts as a really good segment, ends up as an even better match.  Great back and forth impromptu match.  Excellent false finishes and hard hitting action.  The crowd grows to a frenzy towards the end.  The post match is great too.  8.5/10WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchBret "Hitman" Hart vs. Goldberg20th December, 1999This match took place the night after they wrestled at Starrcade and Bret received his career ending kick to the head.  You can tell Bret is not 100% on top of his game here, but the match is still pretty captivating.  The ending was the birth of the nWo 2000.  7.5/10WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchKevin Nash vs. Sid Vicious24th January, 2000Very short match.  Too short for a title to change hands.  Around 5 minutes long.  Crowd really tries to like it and get behind Sid, which helps the match.  A few good power moves, not alot in between though.  Helped that it was so short.  Good ending.  5.5/10The Bischoff & Russo Era Begins10th April, 2000Segment review.  I really enjoyed this segment.  From a WCW history standpoint, this was big stuff.  The entire roster enters the arena for this one.  This was the genesis of the new blood vs veterans feud, as everyone was stripped of their titles and the company was rebooted.  Great mic work by Bischoff.  9.5/10Steel Cage Match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchJeff Jarrett vs. Diamond Dallas Page24th April, 2000This was a short match, but what they packed into it was really fun and action packed.  It starts off as a brawl around the cage and up to the stage, but eventually fight into the cage for the back and forth match.  Loaded with interference towards the end, which adds to the drama.  I enjoyed this quite a bit.  7.5/10Tag Team Ladder Match3 Count vs. Jung Dragons18th July, 2000I was hoping for way better from this match.  The 3-way ladder match they had from Starrcade blew this one out of the water.  It is super short, around 4 minutes, and comes across as more of a segment than a match.  A couple of quick spots, that are good, but aren't enough to make a match.  5.5/10WCW World Heavyweight Championship MatchBooker T. vs. Lance Storm7th August, 2000I've reviewed this match before, on the Rise and Fall of WCW DVD.  It's a really solid Nitro match and a good pick to switch things up.  Most people look back on WCW's 2000 year with bad memories, but there were some really good things going on.  Booker T as Champion and Lance Storm running the table with midcard titles were good things.  These two were at the prime of their careers during this match and  brought solid match skills to the table.  I think if they had been allowed to go 15 or 20 minutes, they could have put together an all time classic.  The 7 minute match we are given though is really solid for what it is.  7/10Triple Cage War Games Match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship4th September, 2000People in this match and simply involved in this match include:  Sting, Scott Steiner, Jeff Jarrett, Vince Russo, Booker T, Kevin Nash, Kronik, Harris Brothers, Goldberg, and even Brett Hart makes a quick cameo.  It is pure chaos from the opening bell.  It's war games style, with a new man (or men) coming out every two minutes and fighting to the top of a cage three stories high.  This match is a giant brawl with a couple of dramatic turns.  Lots and lots of weapons shots all over the cage.  They brawl up and down and there's even a few wrestling moves scattered in between.  It's not classic, but it's a match that when you read the premise, you've got to tune in.  It's a fun bit of chaos and it definitely keeps your attention for the full 15 minutes.  With that many big names in that atmosphere, it's got to be worth watching.  8/10Sting vs. Ric Flair26th March, 2001This last meeting ever between Sting and Flair is also the last match ever in WCW history.  That alone gives you reason to watch this match.  It's short, around the 8 minute mark, and they give everything they have in those short 8 minutes.  This match flies during this match as it is non stop from the opening bell.  You can see the emotion on their faces as they try to squeeze something good into the small time alloted to them.  7.5/10There are only two segments on this disc and I reviewed them both.This DVD is really great.  You are given access to countless matches and segments that you have probably forgotten about.  Some of the matches are of really high quality and the ones that aren't have particpants that really know how to work a crowd and draw you into the match.  I would highly recommend this DVD and I hope there will be a volume 2. </p>

 <p> I will happily admit to being a Monday Nitro fanatic.Every Monday night during the time known as the Monday Night Wars, I was not one of the millions who couldn't decide which program to watch.  For myself, it was really simple - I was watching Nitro.  From the Cruiserweights and the NWO to the reunion of the greatest stable in wrestling history, the Four Horsemen, I was hooked.And so as soon as I heard that WWE was releasing the Best of Monday Nitro, I knew for sure that it was something I'd buy and watch end to end the day it came out.  I also knew that I'd likely regret that decision thanks to some of the other revisionist history that we've seen on other DVD releases *cough*Monday Night Wars*cough*.But what we got here was actually pretty good. Instead of being a corporation-friendly host, DDP does a good job of introducing the clips they chose, describing what was actually happening in the company when it was happening, and setting up the moments as they come.  According to reports, he made significant changes to the script he was given, and I think that you can tell that this isn't the same kind of BS that the WWE put together for other WCW collections, and for that I'm glad.The clips, overall, are pretty good until you get to disc three, which starts with the infamous "Fingerpoke of Doom" and chronicles the subsequent destruction of WCW.  I had never before seen this part of the show, since I was one of many who tuned out Nitro after Schiavonne told us that Cactus Jack was about to win a world title on RAW, and never looked back, and it's interesting to see how all of this led to the demise of the once-great company.  I don't think I'll ever look back on this as being the "Very Best" of anything, and I doubt I'll ever be watching this again, but for the history lesson, it is important to have included.Overall, I loved looking back on all these great matches, and seeing all of the stuff that really made me a life-long fan back in the day.  There is no Chris Benoit to speak of, for understandable reasons (although you can see him in the background of a few clips), just about every other major talent is included in some way, even Dean Malenko, an old favorite of mine who I was sure wouldn't be seen or heard from.  From that angle, they did a great job.Unfortunately, since Hulk Hogan, Bischoff, Flair, Jarrett and Sting are all currently working for TNA, we don't get to see them on interviews, and that is really quite a shame.  Those were THE five major players in all of this, and it would have been phenomenal to hear what they all had to say about what was going on in the company, and to hear some of their reflections on what was no doubt the best time in the history of wrestling (or sports entertainment, if you want to go there).  Hopefully, in a few years when TNA is put out of business thanks to insane booking and terrible business decisions, WWE will give all of these guys a legends contract and we can see some more old WCW stuff let out to light.And seriously, WWE, what's taking so long on releasing a Starrcade collection or a Wargames collection.  All of us old WCW fans are dying to see some of that stuff brought back! </p>

 <p> This is a really good set and I don't think any WCW fan will be disappointed, but I would have like to have seen a few more matches. That is not to say there is a shortage, but sometimes they focus to much on the NWO invasion and not enough on the matches at the begining. Listen I know the NWO is what put them over the top, but throw an entire match in while you build up to that. With all that being said it is still a great disk and if you are a WCW fan  you will really want to get this and enjoy. Lord knows this maybe all we get from Vince and the WWE. </p>

 <p> I just got my copy of WWE's "The Very Best of WCW Nitro" 3-disc DVD set and wanted to chime in with a reviewof the actual product. First, there is some confusion out there because some of the reviewers here on Amazonare listing this set as having these special features: Rey Mysterio vs Mr. J.L. and a segment called DDP Monday NitroHighlights. These two extras are only found on the FYE exclusive version, not the version Amazon, or any other retailer,happens to be selling. The FYE version contains those extras along with a segment of DDP talking about being afraidof heights the night Sting saved him from an nWo attack and they escaped via Sting's harness to the top of an arena.These 3 extras are only found on the FYE exclusive version, which is limited! So with that out of the way, here's my review...Being a longtime wrestling fan (I started watching in the 70s) I can tell you without hesitation that the mid to late 90s werethe best time ever to be a fan, thanks to the Monday Night Wars. As Eric Bischoff put it in a WWE Legend's Roundtable showa few years ago, "every Monday Night was like the Super Bowl". It was an amazing time to be a fan because when WCW wenthead-to-head with WWF Raw on Monday Night both promotions started pulling out all the stops to capture ratings and winover viewers. You never knew from week-to-week who was going to jump from one promotion to the next, there was moreemphasis on actual wrestling, promos blurred the lines of fantasy and reality as stars called out wrestlers and promoters from variouspromotions and you would get to see world class main events and dream matches on virtually a weekly basis. No doubt, the MondayNight Wars burned white hot and this new 3-disc DVD set featuring the best of WCW Nitro shows highlights from the WCW sideof this now legendary era in professional wrestling.Now, this set is titled "The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro", however this isn't always the case. My only complaint with this longoverdue look at WCW Nitro is that they included some pretty terrible moments here, that quite frankly, have no business beingon anything called the "Very Best of...". The DVD goes in chronological order and tells the history of WCW Nitro by showingmatches and memorable moments. I wish they hadn't gone this route because in giving a history lesson on Nitro, WWE hasincluded some moments and matches that are terrible. Why not just put together a collection of matches and moments thatare truly the "Very Best" from the show? This set could've been used to celebrate Nitro, instead it's a history lesson that includeshorrendous moments that should've been left out to allow for more memorable matches and moments to be included. For example,WWE included the tedious in-ring speech from Vince Russo, Jeff Jarrett and Eric Bischoff in April of 2000 where they took the titles away from allthe title holders and hit the reset button on WCW. It's a long, boring segment of mic work that, while it does have historical significance (justlisten to what Russo, Jarrett and Bischoff say, and you'll know why WWE wanted to include this), it has no business on a "Very Best of"Nitro collection. Also, we have to see footage of Vince buying WCW and gloating over his victory of winning the Monday Night Wars. Vince,we get it, you won! Why not let WCW and it's fans have their time to reflect back on Nitro without reminding everyone the WWE is thedominate force in wrestling? Plus, there are a few matches I wouldn't have included here to represent the best of Nitro. Sting vs Ric Flairfrom the final Nitro is important, again for historical significance, but it's simply a terrible match from these two. They wrestled bettermatches on other editions of Nitro, why not include one of those? Sid vs Kevin Nash? Yeah, you get the idea...With all this aside, this is a pretty good collection worth picking up. It'll bring back a ton of memories for fans like myself who tuned inback in the 90s and will expose new fans to what the Monday Night War was like from the WCW side of things. Diamond Dallas Pagehosts the DVD and thankfully he's not WWE's corporate puppet in this one! DDP said in interviews leading up to this release that hehad WWE change the script that they wanted him to read because he felt it was loaded with BS. DDP doesn't introduce every matchor segment, but when he does talk, he gives an honest perspective on what was happening in WCW at the time. I can't tell you howrefreshing this is on a WWE produced WCW release!So, overall this is a must buy for serious wrestling fans. You're going to get a collection containing, I would guess 70% of what I wouldcall the "Very Best" of Nitro, plus some poor historical filler, but the good out weighs the bad here. Sting vs Macho Man Randy Savage,Rey Mysterio vs Dean Malenko, Brian Pillman vs Jushin "Thunder" Liger, Syxx vs Rey Mysterio, Bret Hart vs DDP, Hogan vs Goldberg, thedebuts of Scott Hall & Kevin Nash, Sting walking out on Nitro, Flair returning to the Four Horsemen, nWo taking over... these are allgreat matches and classic moments! As I write this review, the DVD is listed in the top 40 of Amazon's overall sales chart. I'm hoping thesuccess of this release will convince WWE to release more Nitro and other WCW events (Clash of the Champions, Starrcade, Halloween Havoc, etc..)because it's clear that fans still remember and respect WCW... even if WWE doesn't. </p>

 <p> I was able to get an FYE copy of this compilation which had some bonus materials not in the Amazon release. If I were able to I'd give this video a 4 1/2 out of 5 because the history is there in it's rawest and uncut. With Diamond Dallas Page aka DDP as the narrator in this film; you'll go back in time through the years of the various stages and key points of WCW's major production of Monday Nitro. DDP talks about some of the angles, behind the scenes issues, and the overall vibe of the product during its run. I've been able to sit through at least 2/3s of the video and impressed by the compilation of matches up to this point. You get the big stars from WWF who left and went on to help WCW rise above to the advent of the Cruiserweights to the NWO-mania that swallowed the landscape of WCW at its peak. There are also some moments from classic promos like Chris Jericho's 1004 holds and Bret Hart's I Quit speech after he leveled Bill Goldberg with the hidden shield. You also get a look at the re-transformation of Sting as well. If you're a long time wrestling fan and you're a fan of archived footage pick this DVD set up. For back stories get The Rise and Fall of WCW and the Monday Night Wars sets to pair up with this. These three pieces together tell a pretty fair account of the way things were in WCW. </p>
