<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Meets or exceeds my expectations </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I've had this stick of memory for a couple of months now and it meets or exceeds my expectations and I would buy it again based on my current experience with the product and the service I've had with amazon.com for the number of years I've made purchases from them. I don't recall being disappointed at the moment. I can easily recommend it to a friend and am surprised it is not more popular because it seems like a good value.  I would rate it higher but I don't feel it would be proper to give it a higher rating until I've used it for most of its expected lifetime service. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great RAM for the value </p>

 <p> I originally bought this product to put in a computer I had that wasn't running smoothly but that I didn't want to dump a lot of money into.  I was immediately glad I did.  The computer runs much better now, and I feel I got a very good value for the performance.  Since then I've purchased and installed several more sticks of this exact product for computers for family members.This isn't, of course, the best RAM out there (the subtitle of the product is "Value RAM").  It is, however, an inexpensive way to juice up a computer.  To me this is the ideal product for someone who has a cheap computer and wants to improve performance without investing too much money into it.  For normal computing (Windows, internet surfing, etc), this RAM is more than sufficient, but it works for gaming as well.  Of course you won't get the same caliber of performance you'd get from more expensive RAM, but you'll be amazed at the time and headache this product can save. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This is the 1st for me - buying and installing computer memory. But after checking (and double-checking) the type and size, I purchased this product. Much better buy with Amazon. Just unplugged the computer, opened the back, removed the old card and plugged in the new memory. Computer recognized the new memory immediately. Wish my old Dell could use more, but am limited to 1 GB. Photoshop does load in about half the time, so I'm pleased. Haven't had any problems after about a month of useage. Don't expect any with Kingston. </p>

 <p> Yeah, i bought the wrong type, and the customer service at TigerDirect wasn't that helpful at helping me return it. i had to wait for ups to come and refuse the package, which meant i had to be home. so that interfered with my week. </p>

 <p> Runs fine...worked fine ...had a problem intalling the product...would not work at first...call Kingston tech support...someone I could understand! They figured out quickly that my motherboard had to have the memory in a certain order (thier product first)...got it done and the computer boots and runs much faster now. Glad I bought the product. </p>

 <p> Computer was slow as s*%^.  Now it is fast as can be.  Make sure to know how to install it if you have never done it before.  If you are unsure, but this and take it to a pro to install.  It will make your computer usable for at least another 2 years (save you money over buying a new one)... </p>

 <p> Bought one on a really good sale at amazon.com. Kingston memory chips have never failed me and I'll recommend this to anyone. Works flawlessly with my Dell P4 and improved performance with a lot less swapping.Two thumbs up for a great product from Kingston. Do check your motherboard specs and make sure you're pairing the right memory sticks so you don't end up slowing your computer down. </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I was really desperate for more speed on my PC.  My processor speed is decent but I only ran 256 MB of RAM which is pathetic by today's standards hence the reason I decided to get this 1GB stick from Kingston.So here I am all excited about adding more memory to my machine.  The stick fits in perfectly.  I put on my machine and what do I see????  The dreaded blue screen which quickly disappears; then all the machine does is restart time and time again.I brought the RAM and my PC to my technician and he said that most likely the blue screen is because of a hardware malfunction, meaning the RAM was faulty.  I was very disappointed seeing that there were so many satisfied customers who used this product.  I guess I'm the odd one out.  I plan to upgrade once more but next time I'll have to go with a company other that Kingston. </p>

 <p> I have a desktop from 2001 that was becoming increasingly delayed with today's simple proccesses. I'm also a cheapskate and wanted to try upgrading the ram before trashing this old beast. I took a gamble and bought the ram. It did what I needed which was to allow me to continue using this computer for a bit longer for minimal costs. By the way the computer is a dell dimension 4550 Intel pentium4 windows xp if that would help you all. </p>

 <p> I just got 2 of these for my Dell Dimension 8300. Photoshop filters seems to be working faster now. Installation was easy; just snap them in the slots, reboot, and the new memory was immediately recognized.The other reviewers mentioned that this is a "value" or somewhat lower quality memory product. To me, these solid state memories either work or they don't and there really isn't any difference in quality.Hopefully the rebates won't be a hassle as the other reviewer experienced. </p>

 <p> Very good memory for a desktop.  I was pleased with the price for a major brand in memory.  I installed it quickly, computer recognized it and the computer has been running faster since. Just make sure you buy two, I originally purchased one and it worked, but the computer wasn't as happy until it got the same memory in each of the slots. </p>
