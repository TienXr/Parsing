 <p> Loved this book .... it can be read alone or as the third in the Oregon series by Bonnie Blythe.  I liked all 3 but this was my favorite... if you like travel, you will love the descriptions and the characters. </p>

 <p> Just finished the 3rd book in the series "Oregon in Love". I just enjoy these novels because the content is wholesome with some good teaching of How God can work in our lives.Miranda is looking for a half sister she didn't know about until just before her mother's death.  This leads her and Spencer all the way to Mexico with no clues of how to find her.  Spencer is very helpful and eventually leads Miranda into a true relationship with the Lord after fnding her sister.  A happy ending with marriage on the way. </p>

 <p> The action in the story takes place over way too short a time to be believable. The heroine feels justified in committing illegal acts to further her ends, and she's the star of a Christian romance? I found it preposterous that she and the hero would fall in love.  The Christian aspects seemed really forced: she doesn't seem to have much faith, and they're constantly praying for miracles, which BOOM arrive right on schedule. The hero seems to exist to be her human ATM, funding her search for her biological sister, and the pray/miracle seems to make God into some sort of vending machine. Then there were plot holes: how did the villain get a copy of a picture of the heroine that had to have been taken years before she met the villain? Why does the hero so readily believe a stranger who accuses his father of a crime? If the author had had the couple meet in a conventional way (easily done) and have a loving trusting relationship prior to the events of the book, it might have been believable, but the story was like being dropped into the front car of a roller coaster as it's cresting the first hill. You're off and running before you have a chance to say 'Wait a minute, how did THIS happen?' </p>

 <p> Bonnie really has a way with creating realistic characters. Spencer is a guy that loves the Lord, has a great heart and high morals.  He can also be insensitive,judgemental,  and says something stupid to Miranda almost every time he opens his mouth. Gotta love it! Miranda on the other hand is confused about God, is hot tempered, bitter (with some reason), but is vulnerable and compassionate.  Great story. The only thing was it really needs a part 2. You get so engrossed with the characters and their complex situation and then it leaves you wanting to see how things are resolved. Have to say though that Bonnie is becoming my favorite Christian author. I definitely recommend this one. </p>

 <p> I love this author!  You can be sure that she will use Christian morals and values in all her books. I feel in Love with the characters. I hope she makes another book to continue this story. I would like to see what happens when Miranda finally gets her sister. Would love to see her wedding and life after this book. I highly recommend The Oregon in Love & Cascade Bride Series. </p>
