 <p> Stephen Frears' adaptation of Roddy Doyle's novel "The Snapper" was released as a TV movie in the UK.  Luckily, it's available on DVD.  This is a first-class treat all around:  Frears has a deserved pedigree as a director of the highest order (among my many favorites areDirty Pretty Things,The GriftersandThe Queen) and Colm Meaney (Intermission) is fabulous, like he always is.  He's appeared in all three parts of Doyle's "Barrytown Trilogy" about the Rabbitte family  (the trilogy consisting chronologically ofThe Commitments, this film andThe Van [Region 2]).  Frears also directed The Van.This sequencing isn't as obvious in the films for the following reason:  Wikipedia points out that "[t]he surname of the Rabbitte family had to be changed to Curley as 20th Century Fox owns the rights to the Rabbitte name from The Commitments, which featured the same characters."The US cover box is misleading.  Is that even Tina Kellegher hiding behind that sheet?  It has nothing to do with the movie, which is gritty, funny and endearing.  It doesn't require this misdirection, nor does the work of Stephen Frears need to be victimized by tricky marketing. </p>

 <p> I just watched this for the first time in a few years and fell in love with it all over again. I am a big fan of Roddy Doyle and the Barrytown Trilogy and The Snapper is perhaps the most poignant of them all. I watched this film within a few days of having seen The Van again and was struck by a couple of things:1. Not so much the accents but the phrases were much more broad and "Irish" than in The Van. Many more "Wha's" from Colm Meaney and "Thick B***h's" from the females in the cast.2. Even though this was produced for television on a presumably low budget, the result is outstanding. It just goes to show that good writing is at the heart of good movies, a notion that Hollywood never seems to take to heart. When was the last time an American TV Movie merited a theatrical release or even a second viewing? Brian's Song? </p>

 <p> When 'The Snapper' first came out, it was seen by some as fresh, funny, even realistic.  This was possibly because it was set in a working-class housing estate, and had a 'modern' subject matter (a young woman gets pregnant after a drunken car-park encounter, to the confusion of her family and jeering of her neighbours) and fruitiness of language that was a far cry from the misty Oirish paddy-whackery that usually passes for representations of Ireland in cinema.  But although the film was made less than a decade ago, it already seems like a museum piece.  Not only have superficial things changed - such as the colours of buses - but the whole spirit of Dublin has been transformed in the intervening decade: the tensely multi-cultural, mobile-phone-deafening, economically complacent, computer-shiny culture created by the so-called Celtic Tiger was on the brink of exploding, and this film didn't see it coming.A film can't be blamed for not forseeing the future - although the film's deliberate evasion of politics and social analysis is indicative of a film pocked with black spots.  But even then, the film's 'realism' was always skin deep.  The picture of Northside Dublin is very soft - there are no drug-dealers, gangsters, paramilitaries, corrupt politicians and gardai, burglars, car-thieves or muggers here; any violence is cosy, well-intentioned and safely attributable to the booze.  Although the various types in the film are broadly recognisable, their interaction and contrived plot functions (e.g. as Greek choruses) make them seem more like bawdier versions of the communities portrayed in Ealing films or 'Only Fools And Horses'.  It's as if the old lovable rural stereotypes have been simply transposed to the city.What is especially disappointing is Stephen Frears' unimaginative direction.  His best films (especially 'My Beautiful Laundrette') have not only been politically astute, but have found their creative energy in the very tensions between realism and melodrama and fantasy this material seems to offer, but with the exception of a sinister Expressionist sequence in the pub, when the dad's mates in diabolically-lit close-ups mock-acqueiesce to his pretence over his daughter's sexuality, everything is flatly composed and perfunctorily staged.  He's not helped by the predictable plot, although the dialogue has a quaintly raucous energy that keeps you going.  What makes 'The Snapper' a treasure is Colm Meaney's fabulous, broad comic performance as Sharon's builder father, short-tempered but affectionate, aggressive but funny, a New Man in old dad's clothing, with such a huge love for his daughter, that her affair with a middle-aged man might be some weird kind of displacement. </p>

 <p> There seems to be a rising genre where the characters are so stupid, so unlikeable, an so unbelievable that we are supposed to find them funny just for that reason.  I do not know any term for that, but let us call in &#34;Andersonian&#34; after Wes Anderson.  This is a Irish example of an &#34;Andersonian&#34; film.  If you like this sort of thing, OK,  I for one could not stand it.  It wasn't funny.  It wasn't endearing. It seemed to have no point, and I certainly could not relate to the characters.  It was only 110 minutes, but it seemed like many hours. </p>

 <p> Fine acting by Colm Meaney (Dessie Curley) and Tina Kellegher (Sharon Curley) carry this offbeat tragi-comedy about the perils of out of wedlock pregnancy in a working class Irish family.  I think the Pope would approve of how this subject was handled, if he approved of the subject being handled in the first place.What do I mean?  Well, here's an unwanted pregnancy that in the apprehension of some people could arguably be seen as a result of something about as close to a rape as it gets without technically being rape, depending upon how you define your "technically."  (She was drunk and an older man took advantage of her in the parking lot of the pub.)  I won't say more for fear of spoiling the plot for you, but be forewarned that some viewers will find the whole thing uncomfortable.Roddy Doyle, the gifted fictionalist (Paddy Clarke, Ha, Ha, Ha, The Woman Who Walked into Doors, etc) wrote the novel and the screenplay.  Stephen Frears (My Beautiful Laundrette 1985, Dangerous Liaisons 1988, etc.) directed.  Doyle is a master of dialogue and has a warm sense of people that he imposes on his readers.  Known as a realistic writer, he is actually a sentimentalist with a keen feel for the foibles of his characters.There is a kind of TV sit-com feeling to Frears's direction in that nothing really depressing occurs.  There's a neighborhood feel to the taunting, some windows are broken, and there's a fistfight, but none of the kids are on heroin or planting bombs.  There's little violence and the sex depicted is minimalist.  There's a sense that nothing is really wrong in the world, just some slips of behavior and some misunderstandings. You realize, for example, that despite Sharon's continued drinking the baby is not going to be born suffering from any kind of alcoholic syndrome.  Furthermore, although Dessie has six kids to support, we never see him working overtime or worrying about money.Doyle is also a political writer and has a message.  His message here is that the gift of life is precious over and above how it is conceived and that narrow-minded men (grandfather-to-be Dessie Curley) can, through love, understanding and a little effort, rise above their prejudices and do the right thing and feel the right way.  Politically speaking, the film walks softly and carries no banner between the two sides of the abortion question, clearly identifying with the pro-lifers without overtly offending the pro-choice side.Perhaps it is best to leave the politics behind and, like many viewers, simply enjoy the laughs, the realistic dialogue and the warm, chaotic family atmosphere presented and save the moralizing for another day.  By the way, you might have to watch this twice to catch some of the humor.  Either that or have a good ear for the Irish brogue.  For myself, I could have used subtitles. </p>

 <p> Cinematic father-daughter bonds don't come much stronger and sweeter than this.  Spoiler Alert!  "Sharon" (Tina Kellegher), only 20 years old, though her Dad, "Desi" (Colm Meaney), thought she was 19 (funny!), has unexpectedly found herself "in the family way," turning her big family's lives upside down.  Of course, understandably, her parents aren't happy (at first), and upon hearing the news at a family meeting, one of her little brothers even amusingly says, "Is that all?"  The whole family, however, has to endure some of the repercussions of Sharon's questionable choice (verbal abuse from friends and neighbors), as well as her reluctance to reveal the father, but what permeates through it all is a strong sense of family, love, laughter, and ultimately forgiveness.  Although a little rough around the edges (some unnecessary bad language and Sharon's constant drinking while expecting, which is a surprisingly irresponsible oversight by the filmmakers, not to mention a DVD transfer that's barely better than VHS), this one shouldn't be missed, including that touching final scene and background music just before the credits, which always gets me.  Suggestion:  Watch with English subtitles to help with the Irish lingo and enhance the movie as a whole. </p>

 <p> A gritty, realistic and hilarious look at Dublin working class life in the late 1980s based on the novel by Roddie Doyle. When twenty-year old Sharon Curley (Tina Kellegher) informs her father, Desi , and mother, Kay (Ruth McCabe) that she's "up the pole", they aren't thrilled, but there's no display of histrionics. After asking who the father is (and not being told), Desi invites his daughter out to the local pub for a drink. Sharon's friends are as interested as her family in the father's identity, but she resolutely keeps mum about the truth until an event in the neighborhood brings it into the open. It turns out that the father was her friend Yvonne's father George Burgess (Pat Laffan) , who took advantage of her while she was drunk. Sharon tells everyone that it was a Spanish sailor, to avoid the embarrassment and the shame of everybody knowing. However most of the town believe the truth. She is often criticized and made fun of because of Burgess being the father. Because of the incident, Burgess runs away from home, and Sharon quits her job as a shelf stacker.What makes this movie a classic is the robust humour, the working class conflict and loyalties, the family dynamics, prejudice and sexismbut it is how the Curley family comes together that conquers all as well as the general strength of character of Sharon and the loyalty of her best friend Jackie (Fionnuala Murphy).It captures late 1980s Irish working class culture in the same way that Angela's Ashes captures 1930s and 40s Irish working class culture.But with some really uproarious infectious humour, with gusto and without a dull moment.One of my best things about the movie is its theme song being I Cant Stop Falling In Love With You by Lick The Tins, my favourite version of the song-I love that song!A 1990s Irish classic </p>

 <p> &quot;The Snapper&quot; is the second part of the Trilogy of a group of impoverished North Dubliners, the first part being the excellent and almost perfect movie, &quot;The Commitments.&quot;  &quot;The Snapper&quot; falls short of the quality of the first movie in part because the plot line is muddled.  Characters portrayed in &quot;The Commitments&quot; reappear in &quot;The Snapper&quot; but are played weakly by different actors.  The dilemma of the sister being pregnant out of wedlock is not really funny, nor is it a large enough crisis on which to build a movie.  The single exception to the mediocrity is, as ever, Colm Meaney, once again brilliant, funny and poignant as the father of the family.  He paces the film with his performance, laced with perfect comic timing and a delivery as good as any you'll see in any movie anywhere.  See &quot;The Snapper&quot; for Meaney's performance--he won't disappoint you. </p>

 <p> Okay, I have to admit, this one was a bit hard to handle in certain places. Certainly, the expectant mother was having trouble facing the realities of her situation herself. Not the fact of pregnancy - that was perfectly acceptable, and very refreshing, I thought. But the circumstances -- the father of the baby -- well, that was a bit tough for her, and for ME, too, as a viewer...The joy of welcoming a new life into the world, and the love of the extended family was well portrayed. Coming from middle class America, the lack of concern about the financial situation (all those people in a 3 bedroom house!) was really an unusual thing to see, but I really liked that aspect of it. I liked the focus of the movie.. in trying times, the family pulls together, and the REAL issue is that a baby is coming, and that's GOOD news!The strength of the individual members of the family comes through, and their love for one another was really fun to watch.This is a heartwarming movie, and very funny, too. Highly recommend. </p>

 <p> If you are tired of the same overplayed formulas and gross out comedies that seem to keep coming from Hollywood, then you might take a look at some of the movies coming from England. This was one of the first "English / Irish " movies that I had seen. It was a little slow at first, but once you get the rythm of the commedy, it is really very funny. The accents take some getting used too. However; after "acclimatizing" to the language and film style, I was very entertained, and have since begun watching a great many more efforts from England (Full Monty, Train Spotting, Waking Ned Devine)The movie is about a young girl that becomes Pregnant.  EVERYBODY wants to know who the father is.  Her father alternates between his own need to know, and telling the neighbors that it's her concern and to butt out.  The gruff father undergoes a journey of discovering his "softer" side as he tries to understand his daughter and that leads to a greater understanding of his wife.  The entire time, the little quips between the family keep you at least smiling and at times laughing out loud.  This is a movie that takes a little warming up to, but pays off in the end.  I recommend this movie. </p>

 <p> Soon after a wild night at the pub, twenty-year-old Sharon Curley (Tina Kellegher) finds herself expecting a little "snapper" by a man she loathes.  Her refusal to name the father sets in motion a family drama involving her three brothers, two sisters, and her parents, along with her employers and all her friends.  Kellegher, playing the role as a coarse, earthy, yet remarkably sensible young woman (with the exception of her excessive drinking during her pregnancy) soon discovers who her friends really are, as some people tease and torment her, some make remarks to her siblings, some force her father to take direct action in her defense, and all spread gossip.Des Curley (Colm Meaney), Sharon's father, shows the whole world in his face, his emotions ranging from outrage toward Sharon for embarrassing the family to tender concern as her time draws near.  As the eight-member family trips all over each other emotionally (ironically symbolized in their battles for the one bathroom, often occupied by Sharon), the tensions within the family grow more intense.  Widespread speculation about who the father is disrupts the neighborhood, with some hotheads visiting their own brand of justice on the Curleys.  The arrival of the baby offers a chance at resolution.Often very funny and equally often very touching, the film features actors who do not act like actors, appearing to be grounded in the very neighborhood they inhabit in the film.  With the pub as social center, we see the characters' lifestyles and mores--their attitudes toward sex and childbirth, their "escapes" from the workday, their daily amusements and sense of humor, and their lack of concern with the dogma of the church.The second in Roddy Doyle's The Barrytown Trilogy, after The Commitments, this film like The Van, which follows, features author Roddy Doyle writing his own screenplay, Stephen Frears as director, Oliver Stapleton as cinematographer, and actor Colm Meaney (playing the father Des, here) as the emotional bridge among the characters, appearing in all three films and giving a sense of continuity among them.  Set in north Dublin in a lower working class neighborhood where many families spend their whole lives, the film shows the reliance on humor when life might otherwise be too tragic to handle.

 <p> A profanity-laden but delightful tale about a working-class Irish family and their unmarried daughter's predicament. The second installment in Roddy Doyle's "Barrytown Trilogy," following 1991's sensational The Commitments and preceding 1996's The Van, the title refers to a slang term for a newborn baby of undetermined parentage. In this case, it's the baby of Sharon Curley (Tina Kellegher, in a sensational debut), the eldest daughter of the Curley family. Kellegher has a great movie face, not that she's pretty, particularly, but she's enormously expressive, and she portrays a maturity and commands a screen presence well beyond her years. Her scenes with Colm Meaney, who plays Dessie Curley, her father, are precious and moving. He's no slouch, either, portraying a typical clueless male who's prone to quick temper but is no match for a fiery glance from his wife, Kay (Ruth McCabe). It's quite a dilemma for this Catholic family, having their daughter in "the family way" without the benefit of a husband. But it's touching to see how they all eventually rally round Sharon and welcome the newcomer into the clan. Their conga line to celebrate the birth while chanting "seven pounds, twelve ounces" is priceless.Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition) </p>

 <p> If you are a fan of British soap operas (e.g. EastEnders, Coronation Street), this will appeal to you.  "The Snapper" takes place in Dublin, Ireland and chronicles life within a working class Irish family when the eldest unwed daughter gets pregnant.The title refers to the nickname they give the unborn baby.  It is a realistic view of how a small community ostracizes one of its own for  violating their mores, especially when they believe the baby's father is a respected member of the community.  It is also a heart-warming study of how a family bands together to protect their daughter from outrageous treatment and slurs.This movie was released in 1993 and there have been so many other films dealing with teenage pregnancies since, including the recent award-winning Juno. It has a dated feel, like a period piece that does not quite jibe with society today.  Still, it is worth watching. </p>

 <p> The old adage about dropping a rock in a pond is true. When 20-year-old Sharon, (Tina Kellegher) gets pregnant, she doesn't want to tell anyone who the father is because he's also the father of Mary, one of her girlfriends and she'd gotten pregnant while drunk.But, people will talk--and when George (Pat Laffan) brags to his mates what a 'splendid ride' Sharon was, Sharon's father Dessi (Colm Meany) gets word and the fight is on.The effect of Sharon's pregnancy is like a very big rock being dropped in a very small pond in their small workingclass Dublin neighborhood. Dessi's fighting with the George to the point that Sharon makes up another father to get them to stop.  Her girlfriend, who is the daughter of the father of her baby, won't talk to her, etc.  There's some danger here--but not the tumult you'd expect from Dublin in the 1980's.It was somewhat disturbing to me to see Sharon continue to drink even until the end stage of her pregnancy. Some likened this to 'TV reality' in that no one really believed the baby would have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or any kind of damage.The real character development came from Dessi, the grandfather-to-be.  It was startling to see him read a book about women's health and ask Sharon if she wanted him present at the baby's birth--he thought it could be important and had missed all six of his children being born.  Of course, the most hilarious scene was when Dessi realized he could do more for his wife!Probably the funniest moment was when Dessi (who I'd first met as Cmdr O'Brien from Star Trek) was yelling "Red Alert! Red Alert!" as he was hustling Sharon out of the house to have her child.I loved "The Commitments" so I was somewhat biased for this film when I ordered it.  I didn't feel like "The Snapper" lived up to its predecessor.Also, the video quality of this disk was extremely poor on an HD TV.  The dark portions of the film had dreadful artifacting problems.Warnings:You need to turn closed captioning on to understand some of the Irish dialogueSharon's near rape in the pub parking lotSharon continuing to drink while pregnant may strongly effect some viewers </p>

 <p> No other film has ever captured the zeitgeist of Irish life as well as the snapper.  Roddy Doyle was teaching in a North Dublin working class school when he wrote this book.  Much of the dialoge that you hear in the film is directly out of the mouths of his students.What you see in this film is as close as an outsider is ever likely to come to an understanding of working class Irish life.  The unmarried daughter giving birth accounts for 1 in four of all children born today in Ireland.  This is as real a situation as you can have.  The language, the wit, the sarcasm and the lifestyle are all iminently recognised by Irish people as being true to daily life.The bonus of the Snapper is that you get a bellyaching laugh at the same time.  There are few films as funny as this.Absolutely brilliant! </p>

 <p> I have always adored a wonderfully done Irish movie, and this does not fall short nor disappoint in the slightest.  Owning this film since its release in the early 1990's, I have viewed it several times a year, and loved it each and every time.  Colm Meaney shines in this, "Da, I'm pregnant" themed movie.This is a wonderful piece of family life, set in Dublin, Ireland and completed with the amazing Colm Meaney (Des Curley).  His eldest daughter, Sharon tells her parents that she is pregnant and refuses to name the father.  Des immediately tells his wife, "Ok...I'm goin' to the Pub".Sharon is twenty years old, working and also living at home.  She has a very close relationship with her father, many friends of her own, and a heck of a lot of gumption.  I admire her throughout all the mixed up chaos that is introduced constantly, with the ways she handles herself and her Da.He, with a lot of help from wife Kay, gets an education in women.  What you just have to choose to believe (as in what your daughter asks you to) and that gossip and rambling all over town would just cause a schism in your relationships.  So, what do you believe?  Yes, Des, what Sharon asks you to.Colm Meaney simply radiates a bewildered humor, charm and an extreme love for his Sharon.  He protects her, he gets totally off the mark and swayed by town-wide talk, and ultimately becomes her protecting loving father as he began the movie.Des comes full circle with a new understanding of what women go through in these matters, gives up prideful notions and backs his lovely daughter all the way.  I have always loved Colm Meaney and thought him to be the ultimate Irish actor.  It always appears that there is not a role that he could not portray.The children of the Curley family, totalling five, are all in view.  They add so much to this film also as far as laughter and love.  Along with Sharon, they all have the ability to throw their father off with their own shenanigans.  Yes, he does take many trips to the pub.This is one for the books if you want a laugh out loud comedy with substance and a point,  as well as Irish warmth and charm. I would definitely say to go to Ireland for a couple of hours and take a look into the Curley family, you will enjoy your vacation. </p>

 <p> "The Snapper," (1993), a comedy directed by Stephen Frear ("My Beautiful Laundrette,") began life as a television movie, but was quickly judged to be worth being better-known: and so was given theatrical release.  It was nominated for a Golden Globe, and still deserves to be better-known.  The script was written by Irish author Roddy Doyle, based on his own book of the same name.  It's the second of his "Barrytown Trilogy," coming after the well-known, successful "The Commitments," and before the equally-funny "The Van."  It's set in a working-class Dublin neighborhood, and concerns the Curleys, a large, boisterous family.  Now, I'd have to admit I've no first-hand experience of Irish working class families, or neighborhoods, and nobody we meet in this picture is any candidate for sainthood -- neighbors and family are nosy, and can be cruel-- but the picture's funny as all getout.  It's got wit to burn, and hearing the way the Irish use the English language adds greatly to its brilliant charm.It was filmed on location in Dublin, and the locations are fairly accurately used; furthermore, it appears to provide a fairly accurate portrait of the early 90's city.  The film stars Colm Meaney (best known as Chief Miles O'Brien on "Star Trek") as Dessie Curley, father of the family.  It's almost inevitable: you've got to say this is the role he was born to play, giving him a chance to use acting chops that "Star Trek" sure doesn't.  Meaney must have known practically from birth that his "everyman" face didn't give him a shot at romantic leads: but comic leads, ahh now.  Rith McCabe nimbly plays his wife; and Tina Kellegher, Sharon, the eldest daughter, who sets off the action by announcing that she's pregnant, and stubbornly refusing to divulge the baby's father.  Brendan Gleeson provides sturdy support.Warning to the politically correct: you may wince at scenes of the pregnant Sharon drinking and smoking heavily, but that's the kind of girl she is, in no danger of turning vegetarian.  Loosen your stays, forget your strictures, and enjoy her wit. </p>

 <p> I adored this movie; I've seen it probably 20 times over the past several years. Colm Meany is very funny as the head of a working class family, the Curleys. One day his eldest daughter Sharon announces to them that she is pregnant. Despite the attempts of her father and friends to learn who the father is, Sharon keeps mum, and eventually we find out why.The strength of the Curleys is their ability to hold their heads up and laugh when the old gossips and biddies in the town (some of whom, I suspect have written some of these reviews) snub Sharon in the street. Sharon's parents aren't thrilled about the pregnancy at first, but, bottom line, she's their blood, and "**** the neighbors!"To say this film isn't funny because of unwed pregancy and drinking/smoking during pregnancy is like saying "Catch-22" or "M*A*S*H" weren't funny because they were about war. But those films were only partly about war, and Sharon's pregnancy is just a part of the film.This film is warm, unsentimental, and funny as hell. I love the Curleys, and you will too. Colm Meany is wonderful as always, and Tina Kellegher is wonderful as Sharon. </p>
