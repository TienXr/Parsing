 <p> I was given a chance by the author to read this part of the series for an honest review. I am in love with the way this series is going. I can't wait for the next. Unbreakable picks up right where you left off and is becoming more steamy and intense. Absolutely left wanting more. Amanda does an amazing job of pulling you and making you relate to the characters and the story!! Waiting patiently for the next ones! Would definitely recommend this series to everyone. </p>

 <p> Devon and Erin finally tell their mom's about their relationship and Devon shows us how protective he is of Erin. There's some drama to be had but then, what would a high school romance be without it?This is a sweet story, one that I am enjoying as it unfolds...so glad I have a chance to read the final book as well. </p>

 <p> This series gets better and better, beware one last cliffhanger at the end!  The love between these characters is so strong that I don't think anyone can break.  The love scenes are super steamy!! This book is a must read in the series!  Can't wait for the next book! </p>

 <p> In this book Erin and Devon share more of their relationship physically then the second book. As they grew up as best friendstheir love for one another has increased into something so blissful and touching.. It also shows how much they both want to share their lives together and that nothing will come between them unless they don't both get accepted into the same colleges they applied too. The storyline of these 3 books together is how you go from best of friends growing up as children and falling in love with each other and taking whatever comes at them. Can not wait to see what happens in the fourth book Unbreakable Forever... </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Another great read.. </p>

 <p> **I was provided a copy of this book by the author for an honest review*** I am reviewing this book for Shanoff Says... on blogger & Facebook *This is more of a serial series that it is a novel, there is 1 more book after this and 2 before.  This series keep heating up in a good way. This went way past your typical high school relationship and more of a NA relationship. The steamy scene are well written and definitely get the reaction that is meant. We are seeing Devon and Erin's sexual appetite slowly escalate from vanilla to a little not so vanilla. I love Devon and I love Erin and their very mature personalities for two high school kids.The transitions are little hard to follow at times but I was able to catch up pretty quickly. </p>

 <p> I really am really enjoying this series.  It has kept me interested and eager for more.  I am very impressed with Erin and Devon and I love how Amanda's books pick right up where the last left off.  She gets right to the point.  I can't wait to read Unbreakable Forever! </p>

 <p> It just keeps on getting better </p>

 <p> I really loved the direction Unbreakable Together took Erin & Devon. While the other two books focused on them overcoming an obstacle of some sort, Unbreakable Together focused on their relationship and love for one another. They were more expressive verbally and physically, and we get to see just how devoted they are. I'm so invested in them and can't wait for the next installment. You will not be disappointed.I was given an ARC for an honest review. </p>
