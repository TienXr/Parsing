 <p> It's a small diameter cable but works very well due to the short run - 3'.Provides a very clean picture. </p>

 <p> Here's a heads up on buying cables. Buy the next size longer. I measured and 3 feet seemed right. 4 feet would have been much better.The cable functions without issue. I have bought some other HDMI cables  in the past that had problems. This one was perfect (except for the length, my bad)Shipped reasonably fast. Price was good </p>

 <p> Got the cables a day ahead of time.  They all work great, which sometimes does not happen with HDMI cables.  No complaints, will definitely do business with these guys again. </p>

 <p> Ordered 2 of the black 6-footers. Shipping was to take 4-14 business days, and they came in just 4 business days to Sterling Heights, MI. Came in individual plastic bags inside a box. Cables themselves had foam wrapping on the connectors, and under that hard plastic caps. Very well protected. Tried out one of the cables (that feel like good solid quality) and it worked flawlessly. 6 foot length ordered just in case 3 foot ones (also ordered) were not long enough. All the reviews were right, Mounts Cable N more is the BEST place to buy cables from. I will never buy cables from any retail store ever again. Just over 50 bucks for 2 3-footers and 2 6-footers, that is a spectacular deal. Monster would have charged two or three hundred at least, and they wouldnt have been any better. </p>

 <p> Great value, especially compared to local offerings.  The same cable at Wally World costs 10 times more.  Happy with both vendor and product.  Thanks! </p>

 <p> Tried to by one locally and the lowest price was $35 at WalMart. All the other stores were higher.  This cable works great!!!! Just what I needed to connect my Google TV box to my TV. </p>

 <p> For darn near free, this is an awesome cable.  I don't claim to be a videophile, but I bought a Blu-Ray player for the little TV in my bedroom (actually a combination TV/computer monitor thing) and needed something better than the RCA cable that came with the player.  This works great, picture is noticeably improved.  (now I just have to find a Blu-Ray disc to try to see if it's really as sharp as HD TV reception)  I got two 3' cables and two 6' cables for less than a single cable would cost me at a store (under $20 including shipping!) just so that I wouldn't ever be scrounging for one.  Can't beat that with a stick.If you are looking for something to hook up a high end Blu-Ray to a big screen LCD, then yeah, you might want to spend more - or then again you might not.  Who knows? </p>

 <p> good inexpensive cable </p>

 <p> When I first opened the cable, I had my doubts about it since the cable itself is about 3/5 as thick as the rest of my HDMI cables. It has less shielding than some other brands, and I wondered if that would impact its performance. After testing the two I bought out over a few weeks, I can see no difference between these cables and more expensive (and thicker) cables. It's actually an advantage to have a thinner cable in my application (short run from WD TV Live and DVD player to AV receiver) since it makes managing the wires that much easier.These cables work perfectly fine out of the box. Time will tell if the smaller amount of shielding has an impact on longevity. At least they cost next to nothing so even if they don't last forever, they're still worth the purchase if you need a few very short HDMI cables.I'm satisfied. 4/5 Stars. </p>

 <p> I had &#34;lent&#34; my brother a spare HDMI cable... But of course he didn't want to give it back. This was a well priced alternative and works great for what I need. </p>
