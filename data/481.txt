 <p> I'm not the type to waste time re-writing a synopsis, you can read it for yourselves. Instead I like to talk about the content of the book. Kerry Adrienne gave me this book for an honest review, so here goes.Two simple words...LOVED IT!!This is a story that's pretty typical in the romance genre...and not just in m/m. Where there's a MC that's detached his emotions and heart from any involvement in fear of being burned and the other MC that kinda wears his heart on his sleeve and is a hopeless romantic. How in the world can these two come together? It's a storyline I'll never get tired of reading if the author can make it erotically fascinating and give something unique to the story...which Kerry definitely delivers.The artist is immediately stricken by the average-Joe bartender that happens to be working at his showing. But when the bartender bolts, ignoring the cocky artist's advances...the hunt/challenge is on.This is truly an entertaining, sweet and sexy read. I found myself anxious to get to the loving...which Kerry makes you wait for. I enjoy angst in an erotic romance if the plot is keeping me engaged...which of course it does.My favorite is the bartender's thoughts as he falls for the artist. He's writing his feelings after each meeting and it's like an erotic book within a book...which as an author myself...that's not an easy thing to do. You're reading his story, while he's writing a story...and it's so sweet and pure, his heart laid out there every time...sometimes winning...and yes, sometimes he loses, and I found myself pulling so hard...wanting to get to the HEA, but of course not wanting it to end. That's what I call excellent storytelling!! Very nicely done Kerry.Author A.E. Via </p>

 <p> Artist's Touch tells the story of two starving artists, Wally and Kenon. Wally is an aspiring young author who works as a bartender in order to pay the bills as he struggles to find inspiration for his first novel - he is a perfect example of the starving artist. On the other hand, Kenon is a rich and highly sought after portrait painter who has the luxury of picking and choosing the commissions he accepts; yet he too is a starving artist, but Kenon is starving for a true creative outlet, an opportunity to paint a subject that inspires him rather than pays him.I enjoyed watching the drama unfold as Kenon began his pursuit of Wally with the intent of engaging in a short-term affair. They soon become one another's muse and this is especially important for Wally because we soon see his confidence grow as he finds himself writing productively. Wally's increased confidence throws Kenon off-balance and makes for an amusing encounter or two. I found the relationship development to be well-paced and believable.I will admit that I was surprised that it is well into the book (~75%) before Wally and Kenon finally have sex. While Wally's writing includes fantasized sexual encounters, there are only two actual sexual encounters and though they were well written, they were not as hot as I would have expected from an Ellora's Cave novel. This is not said as a complaint, but rather to illustrate that Artist's Touch is more of a romance than erotica.Artist's Touch was a well-written book and I enjoyed it. I look forward to reading more of Kerry Adrienne&#8217;s books.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.Reviewed by Angela at Crystal's Many Reviewers! </p>

It is a sexy hot read and I will be reading it over and over - not to mention I will be looking for more of Kerry's books!

 <p> I was given this book in exchange for an honest review.This read is exactly what the blurb says. A cat and mouse chase. Kenon is a very wealthy artist who has his pick of projects. Wally is a bartender struggling to pay off his student loans and housing expenses. While working a show for Kenon, Wally is approached by the artist and asked to meat him after the show. Kenon is so sure of himself he is shocked when Wally leaves without hooking up. From there on the chase is on.Not wanting to tell the whole story here, there is a lot of flirting, then things heat up, then get put on hold, then more flirting, heat up and more put on hold. Kenon thinks he scared Wally off by coming on to strong. Wally doesn't think he belongs in Kenon's world. Kenon comes up with a plan to hire Wally as a party planner (???) to keep him around while luring him to his bed. All the while Wally makes it plain that he wants to be in his bed. Then there is a missunderstanding caused by the antagonist in the story.Somewhere in Kenon's past there is an ex that used him and then publicly humiliated him. Just how is never said but it is why the missunderstanding comes so easily. I didn't really see love as much as just hooking up. I thought the best dialogue was between Kenon and his best friend Bos, and when Wally was writing his erotica putting his fantasies of Kenon to paper. I didn't like Kenon until the last chapter when I thought the characters were actually becoming more than just the quick hook up. Since this is the first in a series I guess I can understand the quick end, but I think the relationship could have been developed a lot more before the &#34;I love you's&#34;.The relationship between Kenon and the antagonist is never explained either.alot of negative stuff going on there and why doesn't Kenon just get rid of the guy. He really doesn't need his moneyI gave this a 3 star rating because things just didn't mesh for me but there were some parts that I thought were written really well. </p>

 <p> I received a free copy of this book via the Goodreads Don't buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review.4.5 fluffy heartsWhat a beautiful romance. I started reading and did not want to stop. Not only was I curious about what would happen next, I felt compelled to keep reading. This is not a heavy mystery or complicated novel. This is a fun, sweet read with a touch of insta-love.Wally is an aspiring writer. Well, maybe aspiring is a bit of a stretch in the beginning. He&#8217;s not found his muse, and just can&#8217;t seem to catch a break. Until he meets Kenon. Kenon is the artist who becomes Wally&#8217;s muse. I love the fantasy Wally starts writing. It&#8217;s porn. Except all we see are little excerpts as Wally writes. It&#8217;s actually fun to read how he keeps writing his fantasies as a little story. He hopes to eventually connect those vignettes into a real book. I also enjoyed the chase. Wally ran away at first, so Kenon had to find him and actually work for it. Wally is adorable; Kenon is arrogant but vulnerable. This is their story. </p>

 <p> I received 'Artist&#8217;s Touch' from the author through the Goodreads M/M Romance Group&#8217;s Don&#8217;t Buy My Love program for an honest review.This story is told in third person through the eyes of both Wallace &#8216;Wally&#8217; Harte, a writer, and Kenon Alavi, an artist.Wally is a struggling writer that works as a bartender.  He is extraordinarily good looking, supposedly nave, and has very low self-esteem. His low self-esteem is one of the things I didn&#8217;t understand in this story. I couldn&#8217;t understand where he got it from or why he thought that way. The only conclusion I could come to, is that he was poor and struggling. When he compared himself to how much Kenon had achieved, Wally would start beating himself up in comparing his achievements. The other was that he thought no one like Kenon would ever want him other than as a play thing. In this case he was correct, but only at the beginning because Kenon did develop feelings for Wally. I did like the added characteristic the author gave Wally that he hated confrontation and tended to run away when things got stressful. It was a realistic way to add tension to the story.The author did a good job of making Kenon annoying, because I really disliked him at the beginning. He was a jerk and a user. As the story goes along the reader starts to get glimpses of why Kenon is the way he is. I think the author did a good job of pacing the revelations of why Kenon was a jerk.There was a lot of sexual tension with Kenon coming on to Wally then backing off. I can see how Wally got confused. It was an interesting cat and mouse game that was played.I absolutely loved the world the author created with the concept of &#8216;The Guild,&#8217; a place where male artists, I&#8217;m guessing many of them, if not all, were gay, could get together in a very creative atmosphere. I can see why someone like Wally would be completely envious of a world of creative minds like that because I was getting excited just reading about it.The only problem I had with the story was the last chapter, when Kenon and Wally have their talk about what happened at the party and where they&#8217;d go from there. All of a sudden Kenon sounded like a soft spoken woman. He got all chatty about his feelings and didn&#8217;t talk like the Kenon we&#8217;d been reading previously. I just couldn&#8217;t get it out of my head that it was a woman speaking which ruined a lot of the makeup scene for me. Also Wally seemed to forgive Kenon too quickly, making the ending seem rushed.I enjoyed this story; it was a fast, easy read with very few editing issues. I liked the MCs and the &#8216;The Guild.&#8217; The things I had issues with were the last chapter and Kenon sounding like a female and that the makeup scene felt rushed. Other than that it&#8217;s a good book. I give this 4 Stars. </p>

 <p> For all my reviews and thoughts on writing, visit [...]Rating: 3.75 stars out of 5Wallace Harte has a English degree and a passion for writing.  But Wally has a huge writer's block and inspiration is lacking as are jobs. To make ends meet, he has become a bartender. When a job bartending opens up at a new art exhibition by master painter Kenon Alavi, Wally eagerly accepts and forever changes his life.Kenon Alavi is an artist highly in demand by starlets and stars, rich and the powerful. As an portrait artist, Kenon commands high prices and attention where he goes and for whatever commission he deigns to accept.  Kenon is also a major player when it comes to romance and sexual conquests.  Hurt and betrayed by a former lover, now Kenon enjoys only the most superficial of relationships and brief sexual encounters of the non involved kind.When Kenon spots Wally behind the bar at his opening, he intends to add Wally to the list of sexual  conquests he had made, a tag line in a long list of games he has played and nothing more.  But Wally flees from Kenon's attention despite his obvious attraction to the artist.  Dismayed and a little intrigued, Kenon pursues the young writer, getting far more involved with Wally than he anticipated in the process.Meanwhile, Wally's muse has awakened and its focused on Kenon and Wally's growing love for the man.  What will happen when Kenon finds he is the source and main character in Wally's romance?Artist's Touch was enjoyable romantic story, my first from this author. I found it to be sweet without being too cloying,  and based on a terrific premise of an artist's guild, G3,  which Adrienne is developing into a series.  There was so much about Artist's Touch that I liked, from the plot to most of the characters that the positive elements outweighed the few issues I had with the story. So let's start with those first.The character of Wallace Harte is a real plus here.  He is a naive young man, recent college graduate, living the life of a poor writer in New York City.  Kerry Adrienne's descriptions of Wally's living quarters (almost that size) are wonderful. From the conditions around him, and the tiny space where Wally resides and writes to the old neighbor habitually found sitting on the front steps, it all feels remarkably real.  The six story walkup has a dingy, confined authenticity that makes it easy to visualize Wally at home, trying to write on that small desk and poor lighting.  With his  innocence and naivete, Wally is such an easy character to connect with, and even when his writing (which we get to read) becomes a bit florid, well, than he's young and its sort of adorable.Less easy to relate to is the character of Kenon Alavi.  I like a difficult character, and feel it's certainly not necessary to make all main character's easy people to connect with or even like.  But for a romance to succeed, than that character must make a realistic journey from jerk to a person capable of love or deserving of it in the mind of a reader.  Especially if there is a large perception in the status between the two men in the relationship.  Poor/rich, innocent/worldly&#8230;.the reader automatically comes down on the side of the young and poor.  So the other character has to work that much harder if their persona is that of someone not worthy of the other's person's attention and trust.Kenon is unfortunately at the heart of most of my issues with this story.  We flip back and forth between Kenon's and Wally's pov.  With Kenon, we hear all about the "game of conquest" he is planning for Wally.  Yet when a friend calls him on his behavior, then he is quick to tears and hurt.  His actions never seem particularly adult (more like delayed adolescence).  Further events are precipitated when he believes the words of someone he despises over friends, which strains the reader's credulity.  As I stated before, when you have created a self involved and arrogant character than you need to give yourself enough time in the narrative to make his realization of his past actions and redemption plausible.  And that never quite happens here.  Instead there is a rather quick resolution and an equally fast "I love you" to smooth over all the arguments and misunderstandings that had arisen between Wally and Kenon.Circling this disparate duo is other intriguing characters that are a part of the G3 artists guild.  One is Bos, a mosaic artist and close friend of Kenon (although you never quite understand why).  The other one I throughly enjoyed was the Russian artist, Andrei.  An absolute rogue and a pain in Kenon's side, his lively and sarcastic nature just cries out for his own story.  And his was a character that, at least, treated the workers and other guild members of G3 far better than Kenon did.  Again, not a good sign when a secondary character is preferable to a main one.In the end, however, you want Wally to get his HEA, no matter how farfetched it feels, because you have come to care about him and his future.  And he does get it.  The G3 guild that Adrienne has created is a wonder of a vehicle for more stories.  I loved her descriptions of the place and the guild politics that seem to be swirling around the players involved.  I certainly hope to see Andrei again.  Guild-mate Bos too.  So onto Guild story #2.If you are looking for a quick, sweet romance, Wally and his story is sure to pull you right in.  Pick it up and decide for yourself.Cover design by Kelly Martin.  What a great cover, that model is gorgeous and absolutely perfect for Kenon as described.Book Details:ebook, 147 pagesPublished February 26th 2014 by Ellora's CaveISBN 1419947621 (ISBN13: 9781419947629)edition language English </p>

 <p> Very well-written romance story. The characters are interesting and unique, and the author writes settings in such a way that I feel like I'm right there with the characters. I loved Wally immediately. While Kenon is a slightly more difficult character to immediately love, he grew on me as I got to know him better. I believed they were a good match by the end, and was so happy to see things work out the way they did. I can't wait for more in this series! </p>

 <p> I received a copy of this book via Goodreads' Don't Buy My Love program in exchange for an honest review.Kenon Alavi is a famous artist, highly sought for portrait work of the rich and famous. Kenon is openly gay and enjoys seducing the male partners/husbands of his female clientele. He was hurt, deeply, by a former lover and it has taken a toll on his willingness to pursue another relationship. He also heads the Gallant Gentlemens' Guild, or G3, a collective of artisans of all stripes that live in a renovated set of brownstones on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The commissions of the many artisans--mainly Kenon's--fund their artiste lives. Of course, it's always good to have money and Russian &#34;artist/businessman/gangster&#34; Andrei is interested in franchising the G3 in Russia, which would mean a lot of money for Kenon, but the price of associating with the coarse man is a bit steep, in Kenon's high opinion.At the display of three of Kenon's latest works, Kenon meets Wallace &#34;Wally&#34; Harte, aspiring writer and full-time bartender. Wally is startled by the attention the famous artist pays him, certainly because this famous man can't possibly sense Wally's attraction. Can he?Well, Kenon's uber-frustrated that the tasty morsel of innocence at the bar escaped before he could whet his whistle. So, he seeks him out and the chase is on.Determined to have Wally, Kenon decides to hire him as a part-time assistant, then he learns Wally is a writer. This is a problem--Kenon's terrified that Wally will make a scandalous book embarrassing him worse than his former lover had. He moves slowly, however, toward sating his attraction--frustrating himself and Wally in the process. At least Wally knows what to do with his sexual tension:  pour it into an erotic novel, with Kenon as the main character.When Andrei makes his move to gain Wally's favor Kenon can't hold back any longer. They finally do the deed! Of course, learning that Wally wrote a tell-all book about Kenon sends the artist into apoplexy. Will these two be able to reconcile? Are they meant for more than one night?I really enjoyed this one. The language is lovely, and seeing the vulnerable man beneath Kenon's haughty persona was a great change. Also, watching Wally develop his confidence, first as a writer and then as a man and lover was a sweet experience. This book is the beginning of a series, and we can see the development of many story lines to address going forward. The clear antagonism of Andrei will certainly carry forward, however I hope we get to see more of Kenon and Wally.For a M/M romance this one is a lot on the build up and a little on the smexytimes. Most of the scenes were told as asides/flashbacks or imagined through Wally's writing passages. Would have liked a little more meat on the bones, so to speak, but it's an interesting story with great characterization, nonetheless. I was afraid it would rush the end, but no, it didn't. </p>

 <p> ** I received this book free for review from the author through the DBML (Don't Buy My Love) program in the M/M Romance Group on Goodreads.**This was my first book by Kerry Adrienne and I am really impressed! Artist's Touch was a creative and fresh story that kept my attention from the very beginning. I thought the setting was splendid and added to the uniqueness of the book. Definitely a book that more people need to get their hands on!Wally is a bartender, but more than that he is a writer fresh out of college. Wally has been unable to put pen to paper (so to speak) yet, but the need is there, he just needs to find his muse. Wally is working a job for an upper class client. He has no idea that his muse is about to walk through the door and it smacks him like a ton of bricks.Kenon is a master painter that is used to getting what he wants, everything he wants. When he sees Wally he decides he wants him and will have him. Fortunately Wally gives him the slip which forces Kenon to chase him down.I thought the slow burn that started between Wally and Kenon was so fitting. Kenon seemed almost cold at times and if it weren't for his inner dialogue we wouldn't have been able to tell what he wanted. It had to have been frustrating for Wally too. Wally on the other hand almost wears his heart on his sleeve. We get to see so much of Wally and how he feels in his writing it is very similar to Kenon's inner dialogue. I also loved the idea of G3 otherwise known as the Guild. I think that it was fantastic and has so much potential I really want to know more about the other characters within.Overall this was a wonderful story and I am really looking forward to reading more of Kerry Adrienne's work, hopefully in the very near future. I would very highly recommend this book, especially for someone looking for likable characters and just a little something different. </p>
