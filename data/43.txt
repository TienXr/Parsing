 <p> As has been proven over and over, ANY HDMI cable that carries a signal at all will work perfectly. It's a digital signal, so it's an all-or-nothing situation. A $30 4-foot HDMI cable is a ripoff. </p>

 <p> After comparing this Rocketfish cable against a very good HDMI cable , I found that its very good to hook to a dvd player.But when hooked to a video game system like a XBOX 360 or a PS3, the picture is just not as vivid or clear as a better brand of cable.If you play video games as much as i do and you have a larger screen 50 inch high def tv like i do, you can see the differance.Dont get me wrong, this is a very good cable for the money but if your mainly buying a HDMI cable for gaming on a larger hi def tv, buy a better brand of cable. The HDMI cable that comes with the XBOX 360 Elite is a better cable, it gives you a more vivid  and brighter picture.I have had no problems with the cable ends on the Rocketfish HDMI cable, but for a really vivid, bright, and clear picture while playing Black Ops or MW3, i will stick to my Monster cable and the XBOX 360 Elite cable.In the case of HDMI cables, you get what you pay for. </p>

 <p> If your going to buy any Rocketfish HDMI cables and any other cables, get them here on Amazon.com. They are way too high priced in-stores, I saved so much many buying them here online! </p>

 <p> Yep, it's an HDMI cable and it works just fine. It's a bit pricey though. Since I've purchased these I've sought after the least expensive cables I could find which perform just as well as these. </p>

 <p> the cable works fine, came earlier than expected, packaged fine and it works. a word of caution, the cable is thick. so for those (like me) who need the cable to bend almost 90-180 degrees it may be a little tight. but hey its thick for a reason, to protect the cable and it works perfectly! </p>

 <p> nice </p>

 <p> "Stuff" magazine, testing HDMI cables in their magazine recently, found that you really don't gain anything by purchasing really expensive super-grade HDMI cables ("Monster Cables" brand) over upper mid-grade well-made HDMI Cables (Rocketfish brand). "PC World" Magazine found the same thing in their tests of HDMI cables.The average viewer simply can't tell from what they see or hear if they have super-grade or mid-grade HDMI Cables installed. However there is an apparent visible difference between mid-grade HDMI Cables, and the very low grade cables often sold in Bargain bins, or supplied with some equipment. I have a new Samsung LED-LCD TV with an excellent picture; hooked into my stereo system, for excellent sound, and can't tell the difference between hooking up the "Monster Cables" brand HDMI cables, or the lower priced "Rocketfish" brand HDMI cables.That said; "Monster Cables" are very expensive overkill. I have both "Monster Cables" and "Rocketfish" HDMI Cable; and have always found that I can see no difference between the two in picture or sound quality. Simply upgrade as the HDMI standard upgrades. Example: HDMI 1.3 is the minimum standard that you should buy cables for currently, and the New HDMI 1.4 standard is now coming in with newer equipment. Want to "future proof"; buy HDMI 1.4 standard cables.Save the money, buy Rocketfish HDMI Cables. They work perfectly well for both video and audio, and cost less than the "Monster Cables" brand.June 7, 2011 FOOTNOTE: I wanted to add a positive footnote about MetroPCSolutions, the actual shipper of this product; I will buy from this company anytime, their honesty is exceptional.Wanted to buy a 24FT length Rocketfish HDMI Cable from them. Instead of simply selling me one, MetroPCSolutions advised me via e-mail that the HDMI cables only really work well in 20ft or less lengths, and MetroPCSolutions was having trouble with the 24FT length because of this.I admire their honesty, and will buy from them anytime; in fact I just ordered two more 4ft length Rocketfish HDMI Cables from them. </p>

 <p> Works great thus far...have it hooked up to my PS3 running to my yamahaa receiver which then runs a 25 ft span thru walls to my Epson 8350 projector...great picture quality and can't beat the price.  Good deal.  BTW rocketfish cables are as expensive as the cheaper monster cables at Bestbuy...that's where I've seen them sold. </p>

 <p> They're hdmi cables.  You hook them up to your tv and they transfer data to it.  They just do it cheaper than the ones you buy in the store. </p>

 <p> Bought these for my Xbox and they work great. A lot better than the other cheap (no name brand) cables that I had. Picture quality and sound is great. Just long enough for what I needed them for. </p>

 <p> It just works, I'm glad I was able to find an HDMI cable in a shorter length.  It does what I need it to do, no complaints so far. </p>

 <p> I have a couple different HDMI cables that I use, this one is probably my least favorite.  The cable itself is very stiff which makes it somewhat difficult to route it arount sharp turns and corners, and as someone else said the connetor at the end of the cable is longer than usual.  It works OK but but my other HDMI cables (some cheap RCA cables and the generic looking ones provided by the cable company) work better. </p>

 <p> Not the best cable out there </p>

 <p> Exact same cable the guy at Best Buy told me I NEEDED to buy for $54 bucks ($9 hrere)! So what if the orignal packaging was missing? Less plastic for me to throw away. </p>

 <p> I purchased my Rocketfish Generation 3 HDMI cable to connect my new Panasonic Blu-ray player to my HD wide screen Plasma TV. Very impressed with the built quality and performance of this HDMI cable. Also,the cost of this HDMI cable was excellent too. Very pleased with my purchase. I would definitely recommend this product to others. </p>
