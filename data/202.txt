 <p> 1992 when Elton finally overcame his personal addictions and reemerged as one of the world's consumate showmen. Touring to promote his (then) new album &quot;The One&quot;, he stopped over in Barcelona for a filmed concert. The result was this amazing live dvd that every music fans must have.This truly is one of the best shows he ever did. He sounds alive and well and he is clearly enjoying himself more than he head in years. The highlights on this disc include &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot;, &quot;Burn Down The Mission&quot;, &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot; and &quot;Funeral For A Friend&quot;/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;. He also does a few songs he rarely ever takes a stab at in concert. &quot;Blue Avenue&quot; is a track from 1989's &quot;Sleeping With The Past&quot; that is hardly heard. Here, he does a flawless rendition that beats the albukm version by a long shot. Also, there's the slightly eerie instrumental &quot;Song For Guy&quot;, done in a medley with &quot;Your Song&quot;.Also included is a 52 - minute documentary with interviews conducted with Elton, Bernie Taupin and Giannie Versaci, to name a few. Overall a great live dvd that has Elton in top form. </p>

 <p> I really enjoyed this concert dvd culled from Elton's 1992-1993 "The One" world tour. Elton does a really good live performance to over 20,000 people. From "Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding" to "I'm Still Standing" to "Burn Down The Mission", Elton gives an amazing two-hour show to an enthusiastic crowd. The only problem is that two songs from the video, "Candle In The Wind" and "The [***] Is Back", are deleted from the dvd. The best songs here are the beautiful ballads, such as "Song For Guy/Your Song", "Blue Avenue", "The One", "Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word" and "Daniel". The best is the big rocker of the night "Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters", in which Elton plays some amazing keyboard solos. Get "Live In Barcelona". Trust me. You'll love it. </p>

 <p> After finally kicking a long - time drug addiction, Elton John went on tour in 1992 to promote his new album &quot;The One&quot;. It was one of his best tours ever. His voice was in top form, his keyboard playing was magical and he was once again just having fun being himself. Cameras were lucky enough to capture his concert in Barcelona, Spain. It captures the essence of a great Elton John live show.The song selection is great, although I wish &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot; was included. Highlights include electrifying renditions of &quot;I'm Still Standing&quot;, &quot;Burn Down The Mission&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters 1 &amp; 2&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting&quot;. It was great to hear the extended versions of &quot;Sad Songs (Say So Much)&quot; and &quot;Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot; (as if the latter wasn't long enough). His voice is especially strong on &quot;The One&quot;, &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; and &quot;Daniel&quot;. The closing medley of &quot;Song For Guy/Your Song&quot; ends the dvd on a high note.Also included is a 52 - minute documentary that features interviews with Elton, Bernie Taupin, Giovanni Versace, Davey Johnstone and others, as well as a behind - the - scenes look at how the tour came together. A great dvd. I highly recommend it. </p>

 <p> For those of us who feel that The One is probably  John/Taupin's best release since their 70's pinnacle, you won't go wrong here.The Barcelona concert perfectly illuminates a unique show (Versache's famous involvement), with excellent song selection.  The 5.1 sound mix is fair (but the PCM sound choice is not as good).  The documentary is also very interesting. </p>

 <p> Just to name a few: &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters Pt II&quot; (the album version sounds so weak compared to this rocking live performance/jam session), &quot;Daniel&quot; (I know most people are fond of the original..but Elton's older, more mature and slight raspy voice make this version of Daniel seem like an entirely new song), &quot;The Last Song&quot; (the intimate duo of Elton and his piano make this tribute to the tragedy of AIDS unforgettable), and last, but certainly not least, is &quot;Sad Songs Say So Much&quot; (the gosphel intro wherein Elton's 3 terrific backup singers give a bare it all, tugging-your-heart-strings-soul-shout is enough to almost bring you to tears).This was the first world tour Elton had done since the 70's.  Filmed in 1992, we see a post-rehab Elton with a much more serious view of life and a return to the organics of his music making.  This was his last &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; world tour.  In 1994 his aspirations turned from rock to show tunes, beginning with the &quot;Lion King&quot;.  Today, his music is changing from the raw piano driven melodies to more character-driven musical numbers.  In essence, his style and musings are coming from an entirely different area than we have seen/heard over the last 30+ years. </p>

 <p> Elton's "Live In Australia" remains one of his best performances, although the DVD is tough to find.  His 2002 tour at Madison Square Garden is excellent and showcases all the big hits.  "Live In Barcelona" sees Elton somewhere in between, with a new, more mature album out ("The One"), but he is still at his best.With a set of twenty one songs, Elton includes great renditions of, "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me", "Tiny Dancer ", "Burn Down the Mission" and, of course, "The One" (it was "The One" tour).  Elton John also pays tribute to Queen's Freddie Mercury by singing, "The Show Must Go On'.  It is the only song in which he gets up from his piano and prances around the stage.  The finale is a beautiful rendition of "Your Song" and the instrumental "Song For Guy".The sets and clothes were all designed by Gianni Versace and he seems to work without being overbearing.  The camera shots are fairly typical, but the sound is crisp and clear.  There is also a great 50 minute documentary, in which, you meet the entire band, backup singers, tour managers, lighting coordinators and, of course, Gianni Versace.  Also included is a making of documentary of "The One" video, with the video included.  It is well worth the time and trip. </p>

 <p> One Of His Better Videos </p>

 <p> There is always something within the air, when it comes to the music of Elton John. For close to his 35th year in show business, he has made the ultimate impact in what it really takes to be a great singer-songwriter. He has had thirty years in a row of scoring a single Top 40 smash, an Oscar, and everything you could imagine. Still, he has some memories about his rebirth, and they're here as well as it should. Back in 1992, Elton John went back on tour promoting his record, The One, which turned out to be a huge revival in the states, which hit the the Top 10 on the Billboard charts. It was the first time in 16 years he had a Top 10 record in America. The real trick was to bring his revival on the road.The DVD, Elton John Live In Barcelona, was a shot at his first ever live concert, ever to video. The process was highly made to reflect his record, The One. Originally named Elton John, Live World Tour 1992, the concert remains the same as it was originally collected. The remastering process was beautiful, and not a flaw within the works. Still, if you have the VHS version of this concert, you're not missing anything here. The performance highlights the exact same number of songs that were on the VHS version, like The Last Song, Burn Down The Mission, Sacrifice, Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, and others. The sound quality is much better than it was on the VHS version, which isn't sold anymore. Still, Elton John does give his all, like he always seems to, and that is exactly what he is made to do.The DVD only has one extra feature, a documentary which Happenstance created, that focused in on Elton John, reflecting the career he helped to spawn, years ago. Even his bandmates also talk about what it is like being on stage with Elton. The documentary also shows a behind the scenes look at the music from Elton John's record, The One, and also a look at what made the tour a spectacle worth seeing all over again. Sadly, it also features commentary by the late Gianni Versace, who was tragicly murdered in 1997. He seems to give a happy-go-lucky detail about what it is like to be a part of the mania with Elton, and what his plans for the future seemed to be, before he lost it all away.All in all, I thought it was a great DVD, but is could've had some extra music on it. Still, I suggest you get this DVD, and the Greatest Hits DVD from Madison Square Garden as well. For any true Elton John fan, this is probably the one for you. </p>

 <p> First of all, I would like to set the record straight.  Every song from the "Elton John: Live World Tour 1992" VHS video is included, in the same running order, in the "Elton John: Live In Barcelona" DVD.  In addition, the picture and sound quality are superb.  Elton had taken some time off from his arduous touring schedule and, more importantly, had kicked his alcohol and drug habits.  He's in top physical form, and his singing and piano playing are stronger than they had been in years.  In addition, he's touring to support his then recent album release, "The One."  That album marked a return to form for the songwriting partnership of Elton John and Bernie Taupin.Elton begins the concert with the superb ballad "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me," quickly following that with a rocking version of "I'm Still Standing."  A welcome surprise is the outstanding song "Burn Down The Mission" from his early years.  Songs from "The One" include the title cut, "Simple Life" and his moving ballad about aids, "The Last Song."  Freddie Mercury had recently died of aids and, as a tribute to him, Elton sings a powerful version of Queen's "The Show Must Go On."  A concert highlight is when each of his three backup singers perform powerful solos on "Sad Songs Say So Much."  The concert closes on an unusual note, with Elton combining the instrumental "Song For Guy" with his classic "Your Song" for a unique medley.What really makes this DVD worth owning is the inclusion of a nearly one hour documentary about Elton's 1992 world tour, which was not included in the previous VHS version.  In addition to interviews with Elton, Bernie Taupin and Davey Johnstone, it includes portions of several concept videos, and a complete live version of "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" from his first 1992 show in Oslo.  I urge all Elton John fans to upgrade their VHS version of this concert with this superb DVD release. </p>

 <p> I love this concert because the set list is great.Simple Life is hardly played in concert currently.He pays tribute to Queen,with 'Show Must Go On.&#34;He has the backup singers that give Sad Songsa soulful edge. Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters isa classic John/Taupin song. He also plays an up tempopart 2. The medley at the end with Sacrifice,Song for Guy,Your Song,is the best I've ever heard,as a fan since 1970.This is a must have for the Eltonites out there. </p>

 <p> How I wish I could have been at this show.  I first bought this in VHS format when it came out several years ago.  This is an excellent concert DVD and will rank up there in my collection with The Eagles, Roger Waters, Yes, etc.  If you like Elton John this is a must have show.  You won't be sorry.The picture quality is very good considering it was (I'm assuming) originally recorded on tape.  The sound is remixed to DD 5.1 (again I assume from an analog recording)and is excellent. I give it 4 stars only because in isn't in DTS and doesn't include &quot;All the Girls Love Alice&quot; (a favorite from Yellow Brick Road). </p>

 <p> ELTON JOHN IN BARCELONA IS A FIVE FOR ME FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. ELTON IS PLAYING HIS CLASSICS ALONE WITH BACK UP BAND AND SINGERS THAT ARE GREAT AND THE CROWD IN BARCELONA IS INTO THE ENTIRE CONCERT. I LIKE THIS ELTON WITHOUT THE COSTUMES AND STAGE SHOW. HE IS TOO GOOD OF A SONG WRITER FOR THAT. ITS FUNNY BUT I REALLY NEVER LIKED THE SONG "PHILADELPHIA FREEDOM" BUT THE REPRODUCTION LIVE ON THIS IS REALLY GOOD.  "BURN DOWN THE MISSION" IS A GREAT VERSION AND NEVER HAS GOTTEN ITS FAIR BILLING AS A GREAT SONG. MONA LISA...TERRIFIC. AND OF COURSE "FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND/LOVE LIVES BLEEDING IS REPRODUCED VERY WELL. I FIND IT FUNNY THAT ONE OF THE REVIEWERS THAT GAVE IT A ONE STAR FOR PRODUCTION AND SOUND MUST BE LISTENING ON A OLD 8 TRACK BECAUSE THE SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY IS EXCELLANT. AS A PLUS THE 55 MINUTE DOCUMENTARY IS VERY INTERESTING.  BUY THIS, SIT BACK AND ENJOY, CRANK IT UP WITH SOME FRIENDS AND ENJOY A GREAT DVD CONCERT. </p>

 <p> This DVD relates to a concert filmed in 1993 to promote EJ's then new album &quot;The One&quot;.  Elton's voice was much better compared to the 2000 Concert in Madison Square Gardens DVD.  The tracklist is more interesting too as he has thrown is some rarities and some album tracks - whereas the 2002 Madison Square Gardens DVD is a Greatest Hits show.  The other highlight of this concert is that EJ sings all his songs. On the Madison Square Gardens concert 2000 he has alot of guests on stage helping out.  Ok, that's not such a bad thing, but when you go to see EJ, you want to see and hear EJ.This DVD also contains an hour documentary on EJ which is reason enough to buy the DVD.  It's a great documentary and contains some rare footage too, as well as film clips from yesteryear which I haven't seen in a long time.The DVD also boast a nice clear image unlike the Madison Square Gardens concert (very blurry).My review is simply to help you decide which one to buy. Or you could just buy them both. </p>
