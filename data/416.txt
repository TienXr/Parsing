 <p> I love these light airy breezy reads and is a good summer read on a beach or in bed,Susan Hunter needs to be a little more realistic and not so perfect as everyone has flaws here </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> This is the second book in the Susan Hunter series I've read. They are quick, breezy reads--perfect for a plane ride. I was able to finish the entire book on a recent flight and found it fun and entertaining. Sometimes you just want something light that makes you smile. In Big Apple Hunter, Susan finds herself exploring New York City on her own while her friend Darby is busy pursuing a new job. Of course, things don't go as planned, and after a visit to a jewelry store, Susan finds herself the target of a sinister-looking stalker. Soon others join him, putting Susan's life at risk. Amusing subplots of a party gone wild, a gossipy neighbor, and Susan's relationship with her new boyfriend add to the story. </p>

 <p> The worst part of this series is that I read them all this week and there are no more.  Love these. </p>

 <p> Two books into this series and I'm certain that the five star reviewers must be close personal friends of the author.  The heroine is blatantly lacking in anything resembling sense and over impressed with her own attraction of the worst sort of man.  Routinely, she knowingly places herself in risky positions where she could be raped, trafficked, or killed.  I would not recommend this series for girls or young women, despite its lack of content sexual content.  This is not a heroine, but someone whose life is a lesson in what not to do. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Number two is twice as good. </p>

 <p> I enjoyed the second book of the series. The plot and characters were good and the setting was great. I missed Darby and Susan going to different restaurants in this book like they did in the first since they are such foodies. The only problem I had with the second book was that it  just was not long enough. I can't wait for the next one. </p>

 <p> Author Maddie Cochere has done it again, another great Susan Hunter Mystery!!! I love all the details about New York City that Ms. Cochere provides; I felt like I was enjoying the sights of New York along with Susan Hunter. The drama, the action with a touch of romance makes this mystery one you won't want to put down.Well done Maddie Cochere, well done !!! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> The clothes obsession (wearing and buying) was totally tiresome and dominated the storyline.The plot line was so thin, that there was no real mystery in this so-called "mystery".The main character's actions in New York are totally juvenile. She goes off with strangers again and again and miraculously every stranger she meets is just lovely.I loved the first Susan Hunter book, but this one was a waste of time. I won't be buying anymore. What a disappointment for a series that started off so well. </p>
