 <p> I absolutely loved hearing Alec & Demetri's POV in Strung!  Getting inside their heads brought me so much insight into Tear, the first book by Rachel Van Dyken, in the Seaside Series.Her ability to switch from the POV of two very different men and make me understand truly who they are as individuals is truly amazing.  Another work of art by the great Rachel Van Dyken. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> My favorite series! </p>

 <p> As always, Rachel does not disappoint!!  The Seaside series is one of my favorites!!  I love Strung as it gives us the story of Tear, but from Alec and Demetri's POV.  We get to be inside of their heads, hear and see their feelings and emotions!  This book is a must read if you have read the series!  If you haven't, then this series is a definite must read!  The books are great and entertaining!  Alec, Demetri, and Nat will be drawn into your hearts along with the rest of the Seaside characters! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Once again Rachel has managed to pull off a gripping novel that keeps you hooked from the very first page! </p>

 <p> Whenever I pick up one of the Seaside series novels, it feels like a homecoming. Seriously. I have been with this group from the beginning and from the first chapter in Tear, I felt like I knew these people.Reading Strung was exactly the same feeling, and it was one that I dearly missed! Even though Strung is essentially a re-telling of Tear, it is also completely different in the fact that it is written from the point-of-view of Alec and Demetri Daniels instead of Nat's, and that puts a whole different spin on things.This time, you get a greater insight and understanding into why they act and react the way that they do. You can feel a certain sympathy for their past, and the struggles they are still trying to overcome while in Seaside. You can almost feel their pain and self-loathing, and it never fails to amaze me the way Ms.Van Dyken can switch between the brother's personalities and still keep them so real and completely separate. </p>

 <p> As always - Rachel has written a book that I couldn't put down until it was complete - except when I had to go to work.  This was an amazing story from page one.  I absolutely loved it and would recommend this book and any other books by Rachel.  I do recommend reading the Seaside series first before Strung.  Thank you for another amazing book Rachel.  I am a forever fan.!!!!! </p>
