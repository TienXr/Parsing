 <p> This is my first tablet, so I wasn't really sure what size to get.  I went with the largest one I thought was affordable.  As it turns out, this was more than enough for my 22" wide screen monitor(1680x1050 res).  It could easily handle two of my monitors(unless, you're a fan of using really large brush strokes).  When you consider the ability to zoom in and out on your work, it becomes obvious that you can get away with having a much smaller tablet.  Personally, I consider my brush strokes to be about average(though a bit heavy handed, apparently) and I probably only use about roughly 1/4th of my tablet surface at a time when drawing/painting due to zooming in and dragging the image around.  Anyone who's used a laptop touch pad can easily see how little space is needed to mouse around.  In other words, if you don't plan to do any real drawing or painting, you can get away with the smallest tablet you can find.  People who simply want to ditch their mouse can go with a Bamboo but anyone planning to do any type of photo editing or graphic work should stick to the Intuos(for the accuracy).  With all that said, I can easily shrink my tablet in the settings if I wanted to just use part of it instead of the whole thing.  However, I am getting used to taking advantage of the extra space.It did take me a while to adjust to using the tablet.  I've been using a mouse and keyboard for over a decade.  I didn't really think about the fact I hadn't written or drawn much of anything with a real pen or pencil for so long would cause such a learning curve but it did.  However, I did adjust after about a week of use(I expected it to only take one or two afternoons since I normally adapt quickly).  I have to say, for drawing or working on photos, this is a lot easier.  I still prefer my mouse for everything else though.  This is partially because I can't fit both the tablet and my keyboard on the desk at the same time(I usually hold the tablet in my lap when I use it).I don't use the Express Keys that much but after a little customizing and getting used to it, I'm finding them to be faster than relying on my keyboard.  I figure that with time I'll use my keyboard less and less.  I also spend less time clicking tool buttons and more efficiently spend my time just using express keys.  Being able to switch tools by simply pressing an Express Key really saves a lot of time.  Though, I wish I could find a way to resize the eraser without selecting it first.  From what I've seen of the previous generation Express Keys, I don't see all that much of an advantage to the new ones.  The improvement is nice but seemingly unnecessary.My actual drawing skill is not that great, yet, so I don't get much use out of the pressure sensitivity.  Instead, I manually control the opacity.  I figure that as my skills develop, I will probably learn to take advantage of the pressure sensitivity.  I'm just not there yet.  That said, even if I'm not using the pressure sensitivity, it's still a lot easier to draw with the tablet than a mouse.  Since I've never tried the Intuos 3, I can't really compare the sensitivity.I've noticed that the nibs seem to wear down fairly fast.  Also, I hear the surface sheets don't last very long either compared to the previous generation.  I don't know if this was intentional to increase sales of replacement parts or a sacrifice to gain something else.  It does make the Intuos 3 seem more desirable in that sense.Probably my biggest complaint with the whole thing is the pen itself.  It's just too fat for me.  It makes me feel like I'm using one of those fat pencils from Kindergarten.  I've more or less adjusted to it but I'll probably end up buying that slimmer version that doesn't have the rubber grip.Ultimately, if I had it to do all over again, I'm not sure whether I'd get a smaller tablet.  I could very easily be happier with a smaller tablet, if for no other reason than being able to fit it on my desk.  However, the extra tablet space makes a dual monitor setup more comfortable.  I normally find the extra screen space unnecessary but when drawing/painting, there's a certain amount of advantage to being able to focus one monitor on just the painting and put everything else aside to the other monitor.  I could have saved money by getting an Intuos 3 but Wacom doesn't really seem to be supporting them anymore.  The advantages of the Intuos 4 over the Intuos 3 just don't seem necessary, this is especially true in the case of someone, like me, who doesn't take full advantage of the pressure sensitivity. </p>

 <p> I have had an Intuos 6x8 since 2000 that I have used heavily for photo editing and computer painting. Recently I bought an Intuos Small for use with my laptop, and the Medium for my desktop. I really notice the additional pressure levels (smoother transitions)and like the surface feel much better than the older model (slightly more friction, so better line stability). Design and construction are solid, and I hope this one lasts for several years like the last. Programmable keys are useful, but not numerous enough to set you free from having a keyboard handy for shortcuts that cut so much time from common operations. The utility/setup app works fine - you can save preferences for multiple tools and programs (e.g., Photoshop and Painter). I can recommend the Intuos 4 Medium without reservation. </p>

 <p> Great unit, my only gripe is the price. Having had small 4x6 tablets in the past (Wacom also) I wanted to try something bigger. The ONLY down side to a larger unit is that they take up more space. Everything, and I do mean everything, works better on a bigger tablet. This one has it all, pressure and tilt sensitivity, multiple buttons (some programmable), and more. You can read the specs, my opinion is that if you are on the fence buy the biggest one that you can afford. </p>

 <p> This beats my old Wacom Bamboo Fun tablet in accuracy and feel.The improvements are much better and pressure detection.Best part the USB is removable and if damaged they gofor as little as $2 for the wire.Only major flaw is the nibs, they wear out easily. Thespeed they wear out depends on how you set your pressuresettings and how hard you press down on it.So make them last a little longer by doing the following.Set adobe pressure sensivity levels to something you likein firmness etcSet Tablet properties to a level you like in firmness.such as how hard you like to press, how soft etcmakes a big differenceOtherwise Wacom Still has the best tablet quality around.Best bang for your buck.Also buy a computer screen cloth, use it to clean your tablet softlyas dust gets on it, it will scratch it. But doing this method helps agreat deal </p>

 <p> It's the Intuos 4 tablet! The best bang for your buck if you're a graphics person. This is the educational tablet, but don't let that fool you it's the same product in the same packaging, only for less money! Buy it! Buy it now! </p>

 <p> I have been a self-employed graphic designer since 1996. I bought my first Wacom tablet in 1997. I used it until I replaced it with a larger Intuos2 in 2001 (although the first one still worked well).My Intuos2 still works great but it has a serial port plug (that I had to adapt to USB) and is no longer compatible to one of my computers. I hated to stop using it since it has been tried and true for so many years but I made the leap and bought the Intuos4.I am not disappointed. This is a sleek tablet with plenty of room for moving around. Wacom has changed the aspect ratio to accommodate a 16:9 screen - although my older Intuos didn't do this, it was not really an issue.It installed on Windows very easily, no glitches anywhere.The tablet is thinner than previous models, very sleek and easy to rest your hand on. The pen has a nice weight and feel and I use the pen buttons for double click and right click. It is just second nature to me.There is great set-up software that allows you to control every aspect of your pen from click speed to pressure sensitivity, pen angle, button controls, etc. You can adapt how it responds to many programs.It is adaptable to left or right handedness. My old tablet needed a power supply and this is USB powered.The USB cord is long enough that if you like to sit back to use your tablet, there is plenty of give.The express keys on the side are not a big thrill to me but so far I do like the touch ring, especially for scrolling or zooming in or out.I'm sure, given a little more time, I'll find good shortcuts for the express keys, which can be customized, but for now, my keyboard shortcuts are the quickest.I use my tablet and pen exclusively. I can't stand using a mouse and find it hard to understand (with no offense to anyone!)why any graphic designer would use a mouse when the pen and tablet give so much precision and control. For me, having a pen in my hand is much more comfortable and my hand cramps up if I have to use a mouse. It is easier to grab one pixel at a time with a pen than to try and position a mouse cursor.The bundled software is a bonus (you get Wacom Brushes, Color Efex Pro 3.0 and your choice of two of the following: Sketchbook Express 2010, Corel Sketch Pad, Adobe Photoshop Elements for Windows or Elements for Mac.If you have never used a pen/tablet, you really need to give it plenty of time to get used to it. I believe that once you can get past that learning curve, you will love it. It is like learning a new control pad for a video game, you have to train your brain to move your hand the right way while not looking at it.The last thing I need to add is that Wacom is a wonderful company to deal with. For me, the quality of product is top notch, the customer support is great, not that I've needed it!*********UPDATE FOR WINDOWS 7I purchased a new computer running Windows 7. The Intuos4 works great. I had no installation problems or difficulties.AND when running it on Windows 7, it starts up a Windows based program utilizing PC tablet input. PC tablet is resident on Windows 7 and automatically runs when a pen is installed. It has handwriting recognition and will fill in forms as you write on the tablet - a very natural thing since you are holding a pen. In other words, if you are somewhere (online or not) where a field is waiting for text - letters or numbers - a little keyboard icon shows up. If you tap on it, a yellow field opens up and is waiting for you to hand write, in script or print, what you want in that field. It is very forgiving for sloppy writing and if it makes a mistake there are buttons to click to correct the mistakes. In other words, you don't have to drop the pen to type in a field and then pick the pen back up.Personally, I found the pull-out menu annoying after awhile so it can be turned off by going to Control Panel and choosing PC Tablet. The options for turning it off are in there. </p>

 <p> The Wacom Intuos4 tablet is a quality product, easy to use and install. Glad I went with the Medium (had seriously thought about the smaller) it gives a much better real work area. </p>

 <p> This tablet is awesome. The medium size is perfect for me - I was thinking of getting the large but reviewers seemed to favor the medium for what I had in mind. The function buttons are great - even though I didn't even consider these as part of my purchase decision. They are intuitive and accessible. I really feel I've added a new, creatively stimulating way of interacting with my mac. Kinda wish I had the wireless version - yet another cable to clutter up my desk. </p>

 <p> Whether you are a professional artist who needs to be able to get all of the details in a piece of computer artwork, or needing another tablet to update from your old Wacom tablet, this one proves to be a winner! I would highly suggest it. It was a Christmas present for my spouse that has used Wacom tablets for years, and he is totally thrilled with it. </p>

 <p> Wacom Tablet an Excellent Choice for all! </p>

 <p> Intous tablets are one of the best tablets if not the best tablets out there.  If you want a great deal on a tablet the Intuous4 Academic Version is a great deal.  The tablet itself is no different then the regular model.  I only wish I had my Mac and picked up the bluetooth version instead.  The wired version is nice but it would be great if it was wireless </p>

 <p> Still one of the best Tablets </p>

 <p> This is my second Intuos Tablet, the previous one being an Intuos2. I have to admit I never got much into using the Intuos2 Tablet. It always seemed like a good idea, but it's a major paradigm change, and I guess I was not ready for it. I started using the Intuos 2 late in the fall of 2010, and found that it really could be very useful. Not only did I find it beneficial for masking and working with layers of all kinds, I also found it useful for working the sliders in Adobe Lightroom. I found there was much less fatigue using the Intuos Pen instead of a mouse. The more I got used to it, I decided it was time for an upgrade.It didn't take much time to see the benefits of the Intuos4. The illuminated Express Keys are nice, and the are useful, especially since they are programmable. I believe that in concept, they are not new, but the new illumination feature is very helpful. The real improvement was the addition of the 4-function touch ring. What a tremendous feature. It's very useful for zooming, changing brush sized, you name it. It's so fast and very intuitive.The Intuos4 has become an indispensable part of my digital darkroom. </p>

 <p> I doesn't really let me draw like I do with a real pen/pencil/paint brush.I get I expected too much for having payed so much.It's better than a mouse, but not that great.I'm hoping that perhaps I've over looked something. </p>
