<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> I've owned probably 8-10 aftermarket stereos in my driving life, and I have to say this one is my favorite - and it also happens to be the cheapest one I've purchased!  (Note - see "Edit:" below for update regarding audio CDs)My main gripe with aftermarket stereos is that they look flashy, but the buttons are tiny and difficult to use.  This Dual unit, however, has buttons that are more like the factory stereo buttons - I find them larger, easier to see, and easier to push than most.  I appreciate that the buttons have a nice tactile "click" feel when you push them, so you actually know whether a button's been pushed.  The volume wheel is very large and easy to use.I also appreciate that it simply WORKS!  I've used it for about a month without incident.  This is actually a replacement for a different aftermarket stereo - a Clarion that decided it didn't like playing MP3s burned on CD.  The Dual handles those same MP3 discs with no problems at all.  I also love the option to play MP3s directly from a USB drive!  This function works fine and I expect that I'll rarely need to burn MP3 discs in the future.  Note that the USB port also functions as a charger for any of your gadgets that charge via USB - nice feature, and it frees up your standard 12V port for other gadgets/inverters/etc.  I haven't used it with an ipod, so I can't comment on that.The sound from this stereo is great - speakers are definitely the limiting factor.  It does seem like the EQ presets are pretty limited - i.e. they don't sound all that much different from each other.  The manual bass/treble controls are fine.The only thing I thought was odd is that the great big middle button (marked "select" and with a power symbol) is not actually a power button (unless you hold it down?).  With other stereos, I'm used to hitting the power button to effectively "pause" a disc, since most car stereos don't have dedicated pause buttons.  With this Dual, though, if you just hit the "select/power" button, it puts the unit in "random" mode, and jumps to a track somewhere else on the disc.  NOT what I was looking for when I wanted to pause the disc, find my headset, and answer a phone call!  I've gotten used to this, though - if you just push the "mode" button (far left) that switches to USB (or radio or Aux) mode and effectively pauses the disc.  This mode button is much smaller and less obvious than the "select/power" button, but it works.  Edit: there is also a pause button (one of the numbered preset buttons) immediately to the right of the big power button.  Pretty small, but another option for pausing playback of USB, MP3, or audio CD tracks.Installation is the same as with any other unit - get a wiring harness for your car model (not included with the stereo), match up wire colors, and use crimp connectors, but that's not too difficult, especially if you've done it before.  I do recommend wrapping up the whole bundle of soldered or crimp-capped wires with electrical tape, just in case any of the connections might try to work loose over time (I've seen that happen).  It does come with little L-shaped removal "keys" to pull an old stereo out.Overall I'm very impressed with this stereo.  I wouldn't hesitate to order another one of these if a factory stereo fails, or just for the convenience of the USB port.EDIT: After more extensive use, I've noticed that this unit tends to skip when playing audio CDs.  MP3s burned on a CD are fine, but straight audio tracks from a standard music CD will skip on surprisingly small highway bumps.  Last time I heard this may skips was the mid-90's - surely the technology has improved since then!  But this player still struggles.  I took off a star for this, since it's a pretty serious fault, that I haven't noticed on any other car CD player for the last 15 years. HOWEVER - if most of your listening is radio, MP3-CD, AUX, or USB, this unit would still be an excellent choice.Andy </p>

 <p> Bought this so I could switch from playing CDs to using a 4 Gig USB flash drive to play music in my Miata.  Because my car rides a bit hard (hey, it's a sports car) it is hard on CD mechanisms and they tend to fail after a year or two and then start skipping (even the ones that brag about their anti-skip capability).  By switching to USB flash drives for holding my music I eliminate the failure of the mechanical mechanism of a CD drive.  So far the unit works great, no skiping even on rough roads (lots of construction on my route to work lately).  As far a the audio quality, it is fine for my old ears, and besides, let's get real, how important is having a super fine receiver in a sports car convertible.  Those who outfit these cars with premium sound systems really shouldn't have a sports car as they are missing the point, they are a "drive's car" not a rolling sound studio.  So, to summarize, it is a very nice unit for the money. </p>

 <p> does the job.  only gripes are that the buttons are small and hard to see.  but it was fairly easy to install and is an improvement from the factory Subaru unit (1999 Impreza). </p>

 <p> Purchased this unit on sale at Fry's for about $79 including installation for my wife's 2002 Civic.  This relaced a four-year-old JVC player,that replaced a six-year-old factory player.  Both had progessive problems that made them hard to use (they did not just stop working).  We have had this unit for several months and my wife - who only uses the radio and (mostly) the CD player - considers it to be a good easy-to-operate radio/CD player.  The only problem is the display which, at it's highest setting, is not bright enough to be seen during the daylight hours with sunshine.  Otherwise it is a good player for the price. </p>

 <p> Good CD/radio but display not bright </p>

 <p> The features work, but the higher end Dual is a better deal.  This model is very limited to what you can see on the display.  Also, it works for crap in the winter months.  When it gets really cold, you have to push the reset button for it to turn on.  Keep it warm and it works okay.  I use the AUX jack a lot.  Definitely worth the money if you have a broken factory radio, but the higher end model is better. </p>

 <p> Works for the most part </p>

 <p> The thing works great for what you're gonna pay for it, I'd highly recommend it for a low range upgrade (with a frontside Aux and USB) if you don't want a total piece of crap. </p>

 <p> For the price? </p>

 <p> The CD player stopped working after a year and a half of mild use. I won't miss it because I use the USB more. </p>

 <p> OK </p>

 <p> Some idiot thief stole the faceplate only of this unit from my Jeep. I always liked this unit for the feature set and the fact that it had enough power on it's own to sound OK without all that pushed-too-hard consumer electronics distortion. So I ordered a replacement because I knew I was satisfied with the unit and, even better, I didn't have to wire a new harness or do any real work to be up and running. The USB and disc playlist functions are superior to my wife's 2012 Jetta system, the AUX functions well with whatever portable device you wish to use. The big bonus is preset initial gain on each function so that switching from AUX to radio or disc doesn't blow you out or disappear volume wise. I really like this product for the feature set/price point and functionality. I probably never would have paid $150 for it, but at Amazon's price, or even another $20, it's a steal! </p>
