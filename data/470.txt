 <p> This book had me gripped from the start.This story is heartbreaking after years of abuse at the hands of her mother Emma feels empty, alone and never feels good enough for anyone or anything. She doesn't know what loves is and doesn't think she can be loved.Emma decides to leave her parents house and go to America, on her first night there she meets Aiden. Emma offers Aiden to have a one night stand only to find out he's her new flat mate (how embarrassing).There's an instant attraction between Emma and Aiden but he realizes that somethings going on with her and he really wants to help her.When Emma's Visa runs out she has no choice but to go home. Does Aiden go and bring her back?There is loads more to this story but i don't want to give any spoilers out. I loved how this book was in both of their POV. I loved how connected i felt to the characters. </p>

 <p> This is my second book I have read by Michelle Horst and let me say she is just incredible. I could not put this book down. The love story between Aiden and Emma was amazingly beautiful. I was immersed in the story. I felt so connected to the characters. It takes a lot for a book to make me emotional and this book took me on an emotional roller coaster in the best way possible. Unbelievable writing from beginning to end. Once again leaving me wanting to read more of this wonderful authors work. Michelle Horst has touched me with her writing and I am excited to read more of her work. </p>

 <p> Aiden I loved his thoughts, actually I just loved him in general, &#34;then she surprise me by trailing her hands down and taking hold of my pants. She grinds down real hard into me, making my vision blur for a second. This is not good, I'm definitely not going to be able to keep control of anything if she goes down there.&#34; He likes to reassure Emma that nothing bad happened while she was drunk off her a**, &#34;we didn't have sex, if that is the reason for all the bloody hells,&#34; he smiles, and it makes him look even more dishy.&#34; So with Emma being from a different country, Aiden has to google search some words, &#34;I scroll down the long list of words, taking in a few as I look for &#34;French letter&#34; and then I laugh. &#34;Really? Where do y'all get these words from? Why not just call it a condom?&#34; I keep scrolling down until I find &#34;rumpy, pumpy&#34; &#34;Sexual intercourse.&#34; I'm struggling not to laugh. I have a one track mind, because all I'm thinking is the course I'd like to inter with her, sexually.&#34; Emma has some naughty thoughts of her own when it comes it Aiden, &#34;will you hold this for me?&#34; His sweater appears in front of me and I take hold of it. I stand, once again totally transfixed, as he slips out of his slacks. Oh. Bloody. Hell. God save the Queen and my raging hormones. I don't think I'm going to survive the evening. He has now stripped down to only shorts, black ones with words written in  gray on the side.&#34; </p>

 <p> Aiden Holden spends his life fighting for those that can't fight for themselves.Emma Walker has spent her whole life being her mother's verbal and sometimes physical punching bag.After a little mix up about living arrangements these two are roommates much to Emma's embarrassment and Aiden's surprise.The journey these two travel together is at times funny and at others down right gut wrenching.The road to true love is seldom easy and this one has more than a few bumps along the way.I started this book and was immediately captured I could not put it down! This one of my top ten reads for 2014 </p>

 <p> ***I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.***Wake Me Up is a heartbreaking story of abuse and second chances. Emma has fled her home in England to the southern part of the United States to escape the mental abuse of her mother. Little does she know how much her life is going to change especially when she meets undercover detective, Aiden. He helps her escape a potentially dangerous situation she finds herself in when she goes to a bar the first night in town. Aiden becomes an important part of Emma's life after this first meeting.The book is not your standard boy meets girl, and all is right with the world. Their romance and chemistry moves very quickly, but there are huge obstacles that they have to overcome. And, it won't be easy! Emma is a very complex character, and there were times she really got on my nerves with her hot and cold attitude with Aiden. I just wanted to shake her, and tell her, "Look at this awesome, loving man standing in front of you who wants to save you. Are you an idiot?" However, I realized this was what she had been conditioned to do. This became very evident to me when she made the statement about love."Love is such a petty thing, Aiden. It destroys."At that point, I hurt so bad for her! She was being torn down by the woman who was supposed to protect her with her life, her mother. I liked the comparison made with the eagle in relation to her situation. I LOVED Aiden and his family. He was a broken man as well losing his sister the way he did. But, he had such a loving family to get him through that, and they were so open and accepting of Emma. I also liked the dual POV's; I enjoy knowing what's going on in both characters' minds.While I really enjoyed the book, I felt like it ended too soon for me. I am hoping this isn't the last we will get to see Emma and Aiden. I feel there is so much more left to tell about the two of them, especially Emma. She hasn't overcome all of her issues by any means. However, in my opinion, the author was staying true to Emma's character. There is no way she could tie up all of Emma's issues so quickly...that would not be realistic. I am looking forward to reading more from this author! </p>

 <p> I was given the honor of reading and reviewing for this awesome author. I absolutely loved this book. Poor Emma had so much she dealt with just trying to find happiness. And Aidan trying to get thru all his issues. Together even more is added in their lives. It was awesome how they worked together to help each other and make their lives better. </p>

 <p> and there it is in a nutshell - I was destroyed by Aiden and EmmaPoor Emma has escaped to America away from a tyrannical, abusive mother and father devoid of anything useful at all.  She is desperate to try new things, to experience new things and she is certainly going to find that.Aiden Holden is amazeballs and that is all.  Just about everything about this bloke makes me swoon.  I love his family interplay, I love how descriptive his thoughts are.The most inspired writing from Michelle comes in the flashbacks and nightmares Emma suffers - I think my heart broke for her over and over again.This was my first introduction to Michelle and with Vaalbara coming out soon and more in the Tainted Ink series I can't wait. </p>

 <p> &#34;If you want to forget something or someone, never hate it, or never hate him/her. Everything and everyone that you hate is engraved upon your heart; if you want to let go of something, if you want to forget, you cannot hate. ~C. Joybell C.A second chance in life.This is what all Emma is asking for. Her mother won't allow her freedom and makes her a prisoner of nightmares that hunts her.But Emma fights back. Emma loves. Emma wakes up.I feel real connection to the story. All events were real though dark, and abusive. It speaks of reality. Wake Me Up is great story of finding love in the sea of hate, doubt and unforgiveness.On a lighter note,  from the characters name, Aiden and Emma, I love the novel almost immediately. Add the British card to it. I surrender to anything British. Set in England, and USA with a little bit of Africa, Michelle Horst had taken me to places with Emma is her journey to find freedom.Symbolism. I admire the symbolism used in here as the eagle. As a reader, I had easily relate to what Emma feels through the vivid descriptions of how she wanted to be like the eagles.Even though the story is mainly on Emma, Aiden was a great of a hero too. His protectiveness and ever- determined love for Emma is one to fall for. He'd been a great partner with Emma through the dark and the light.I also loved the action that comes within the story. The fight, kidnapping etc. It add more dense to the story that hooked me more.Wake Me Up is a great story of fighting for life and love. Freedom is always handed to us. It's our choice to own it or leave it.&#34;It's not a dream, Emma. There's no wakin' you up. It's only gonna get better.&#34; </p>

 <p> This is an exciting story about breaking free of what other's want for us and learning to be the person we want to be. Emma has left England for Chapel Hill North Carolina to get away from her troubles. Chloe is her best friend from nursing school and is still in England dealing with her own issues. Aiden is the first person Emma truly meets in her new hometown on her first night out on the town. The plot thickens as Emma and Aiden find out that they are roommates. As the plot continues to thicken Emma has to make some pretty big decisions that could potentially change everything. This book is fast paced and thick with twists and turns. I found it to be an amazing and captivating read. I look forward to more from this author. </p>

 <p> It's not very often that I feel completely satisfied when I finish reading a book but I do with wake me up. It was action packed, the right amount of drama and then there's Aiden. Never before has there been a male character written so well. He's full of love. He shows his emotions and you can feel them. Aiden and Emma are a perfect fit. This is a wonerful, amazing, sexy book. </p>
