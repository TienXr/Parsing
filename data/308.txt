 <p> There are no words to describe how deeply I was touched by this book. It tugged on so many different heart strings--one minute I was happy crying and 20 minutes later I was ugly girl crying. All of those awkward emotions and insecurities and new experiences from my high school years came rushing back to me in vivid color. The beauty of reading great YA fiction in my 30s as opposed to in my teens, is that I can relate to the characters from many perspectives--as a mother, a daughter, a wife, a girlfriend, etc.--which only increased my emotional involvement in the story. This book was just so REAL for me...I'm speechless. Highly recommended!!!! </p>

 <p> This book reminds me of the movie Crash; a bunch of characters thrown together to make a whole. It's something I don't particularly like. This book is in Leslie's perspective but there isn't much happening to her just everyone around her. I just didn't see where the story was going so I couldn't finish it. I was at 91% and thinking when was Leslie going to be happy. I would have liked to read about any other character in the book other than her. I think all the other characters had more depth to them, Leslie was just plain and didn't have real problems like the others. This book had a really good synopsis but that's about it. Once I started getting into the story then I figured something good was going to happen like a good romance, but it didn't happened. When I read a book I'm looking for a good romance, this book's blurb says clearly that Leslie finds love, but if I have to wait until 91% or more for a romance to happen, it's not worth it to me. What type of romance can you have/create with only 10% of the book?So if you're the kind of person that liked the movie Crash and like books that have more important and life changing things happening to other characters and not the main character then this book is for you, but it's not for me. I think the book would have worked better the book was in the other characters' perspectives as well and that somehow they found a happy ending, but up until I read everything was unresolved for everyone and I don't get how all that can get resolved in 10% of the book unless it was rushed. </p>

 <p> When it comes to YA novels, my biggest pet peeves are: TSTL girls, THTB guys, whiny teenagers, and instalove. Though this book contained hints of these various devices, it never went too far. I feel like I should have loved it, given the lack of these things I hate, and the addition of many elements that I enjoyed. But I didn't.Accidents & Incidents tells the story of a surprisingly down-to-earth girl with some realistic problems. Leslie fights with her mother, breaks up with her boyfriend, and hides an inappropriate crush. I could relate to her, and these experiences, most of the time. So what is my problem?1. The characters (including Leslie) suffered from an overall lack of depth. It was suggested in places, and teased in others, but the full-on emotional connection I wanted to have here never took place. I liked Leslie, but I never loved her.There are ways of making bland characters unforgettable. I don't need everyone to be Katniss Everdeen or Bridget Jones. I just need them to stand out enough to make an impression. Leslie never did.2. Many times I felt everyone was just going through the motions. Leslie's behavior (and those around her) was predictable. No surprises, no &#34;Wow!&#34; moments here. Everyone did what you pretty much thought they'd do anyway. That doesn't give much incentive to finish a book.3. The great thing about straight-up contemporaries is the emotional drama. Nobody has to die, nobody has to fight an elf king. The conflicts can be blessedly simple: the awkwardness after a bad first date, the embarrassment after a rejected pass. There were opportunities here for these simple scenes, but the author either glossed over, or just left out, many moments of &#34;consequence.&#34;4. Speaking of... The timeline was occasionally jarring. Weeks pass with nothing more than a mention of the next holiday's approach. What happened in the meantime? This is partially tied to #3, as certain chapters closed with the expectation of certain scenes, which were never given except in brief, unsatisfying recap.5. Technical issues. Though I would say this book is quite readable, I did notice an ongoing issue with commas - primarily those I should have seen, and didn't. This wasn't overly distracting, but something I took note of and frowned.Overall, this wasn't a bad book. My disappointment stems from the fact that it was, instead, rather forgettable. Leslie and her friends are already fading, less than a day after I finished reading. I wasn't emotionally exhausted after the read, nor was I completely invested at any time in this book. It wasn't bad, merely...okay. </p>

 <p> When I first started reading this book, it drew me in and I was excited for Leslie to be able to find the perfect guy being as she had such a hard time trying to please her mom and keep her happy.As the book progressed, I was actually waiting for a pivotal moment for something to happen to keep me interested. However, that did not happen. I felt like I was at a long frat party putting up with the teenage drama that is carried on at those. This book never really kept my attention and I kept waiting for her to get her guy but I was just very disappointed with this one. It could have been such a great story but everything that I had wished for happened in the last chapter and then just seemed too rushed. </p>

 <p> Accidents & Incidents is a good read for Young Adults.  Leslie lives with her single mom and is a high school student living in North Carolina.  Leslie is trying to navigate her way through her first &#34;love&#34; and the highs and lows that go with it.Being a parent, I was able to relate to Leslie's mom somewhat, which I don't know if it is a good thing or not.  LOL  Leslie's mom has the best interest at heart for Leslie but she is going through tough times herself.Dennis, is the new boy at school.  Keith is Leslie's boyfriend, and then their is Cain, Keith's best friend. Right here with these three characters, you know there is going to be boy drama.  Let's not forget some &#34;girl&#34; drama that is intertwined into the story.  The author has done a really good of helping me and others relive their high school years.I really enjoyed reading this book.  The author did a great job of exploring high school life/romance through Leslie.  This book was written in good taste and over the summer I hope my middle school age daughter will have time to read it. </p>

 <p> Leslie is used to watching her step, living with her strict mother and navigating the social minefield of her high school. She wants more from life than the popularity that comes from a boyfriend she might not even like that much, but can&#8217;t help but feel welcomed into the group lead by her longtime crush, Cain. When Cain starts to notice Leslie she can&#8217;t help but feel good, but things get complicated when she befriends Cain&#8217;s girlfriend. Add in the mysterious new guy, Dennis, who seems to get Leslie despite her misgivings and all of a sudden life and love just got a whole lot more complicated.I really enjoyed Accidents & Incidents! Riley Graham has created a cast of characters that are not only realistic and relatable, but truly likeable as well. From the first page I was invested in the outcome for the protagonist Leslie. She&#8217;s sweet and fumbling like any teenage girl might be and has a strong desire for something more in her life. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Leslie and her mother. Although her mother is at times nitpicky and demanding of her daughter, I could feel the love that backed up her actions and wanted so badly for she and Leslie to get on the same page. When Leslie&#8217;s mom finally starts to get the breaks in life that she deserves I cheered for her and for Leslie as well.Accidents & Incidents has a central love story that is both endearing and complicated. I found myself rooting for Leslie as she slowly figured out which boy was really right for her. Teenage love in real life is complicated and I found this book to reflect all of the roller coaster emotions of that. I like that the romance is a central storyline but that it doesn&#8217;t dominate the entire novel. The reader is drawn into Leslie&#8217;s entire life, including friends and family, with the romance rounding out the perfect equation. Every relationship is well-roudned and moves the story forward.I would recommend Accidents & Incidents to both young adults and adults alike. It is a clean contemporary romance suitable for any age level. Teens will relate to Leslie and her struggles and adults will be drawn back to a time in their life when everything is uncertain in that familiar teenage way. </p>

 <p> I enjoyed this book - it is a very simple, quick read and has enough turning of events to keep you entertained the whole time. I would have loved if it was even longer so that we could have explored the situations with Dennis and Cain a bit more. Both of those situations might have been given more depth just a little and it wouldn't have hurt the book's pacing, I don't think! I really liked the character of Dennis - these quiet, nice guy types don't get enough credit in YA books! I think I like them more than the bad boys. Leslie was definitely flawed, but you feel for her that her mom is a constant nag and she doesn't have a father figure around. Overall it was a very well-rounded cast of characters and an easy book to enjoy. No big plot device or anything like that, just the life of a teenage girl. I received a free ARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for my honest review. </p>

 <p> Book Review- Accidents & Incidents by Riley GrahamLeslie lives with her mom, who is very critical of her.  Her mom had to quit college to have Leslie and seems to have lots of regrets.  Leslie hates being at home, so she dates Keith.  He is her first boyfriend and things have been going great until about three weeks ago.  He started being more distant and they started fighting with each other more.  When she finds out he wants to be with someone he used to hate, she is heartbroken.  She turns to her new friend Dennis.  He is a new student from Ohio.  He has his own demons, but they become fast friends.As time goes on, Leslie is involved in all sorts of incidents that occur between her friends and herself.  There is heartbreak, friendships made, friendships broken, and new love discovered.  She finds that accidents have affected the lives of her friends and how they deal with loss determines how they move on.This is a good YA story.  It is a believable storyline and I know readers can relate to Leslie.  Teenage relationships are hard and seem to be ever changing which the author does a good job of showing in the story.  I also like how Leslie finds love in another place, a more positive place.The characters aren&#8217;t perfect and all have their own issues no matter their popularity or how much money they have.  No one has the better life and Leslie learns that what she has isn&#8217;t as bad as she thought.  I give this story a 4 out of 5. </p>

 <p> If you like Young Adult books that dont push the line, this is definitely for you. With so many blurred books out there that are borderline New Adult, its not very often I find a solid pure young adult read.These characters were believable. So much about high school is typical no matter where you go to school and I think the author really does a great job of having a true high school feel the the novel.The great thing about this book was that there were so many diverse characters. Everyone had something going on in their personal life and the Author did a great way of giving all of the characters their chance to come through even though we are hearing the story solely through Leslie.Every nuance of the awkward, emotional, difficult time that High School is really shines through in this novel. </p>

 <p> Go home and hug your mother, because after reading about Leslie&#8217;s, you will be grateful for what you have.As difficult as it is to live up to her critical mother&#8217;s standards, Leslie does a capable job. She may not clean the kitchen as her mother prefers, but she earns good grades, dates a good guy, and is well thought of in high school.But there is the teensy matter of being attracted to Cole, her boyfriend&#8217;s best friend. And really liking Meredith, Cole&#8217;s girlfriend. And slowly developing a friendship of sorts with Dennis, a loner who sneaks smokes in the parking lot. So when her boyfriend breaks up with her, Leslie has to navigate her way through the minefield that is high school relationships. What will happen with Cole? What about Meredith? And what will happen with Dennis?This is an enjoyable book with characters who feel real. Okay, maybe not Cain&#8217;s father. He seems so smarmy that you need to take a shower after reading the sections in which he appears. But we all knew a Cain in high school, every school has a Dennis, and at one time or another, we might have been Leslie.That&#8217;s the selling point for this book: it feels real. Sometimes almost too real. When Leslie lets Cain press his leg against hers under a blanket, we know that she&#8217;s attracted to him. We understand the battle she has with herself about what&#8217;s acceptable and what isn&#8217;t. Meredith is pretty great, and she&#8217;s a good friend to Leslie. She doesn&#8217;t deserve to get hurt, but Leslie likes Cain so much. Meanwhile, her friendship with Dennis slowly progresses. But can they really be friends? They are so different.Perhaps. They might be more alike than either realizes.Teens will love this book because they will see themselves and their friends in it. Leslie is someone you can empathize with, and her struggles with her mother are presented without sympathy. This is Leslie&#8217;s challenge to surmount, and she needs to figure out how to do that for herself.I enjoyed this one a great deal.Thanks to NetGalley for the previewPublished on cupcake's book cupboard@VivaAmaRisata </p>
