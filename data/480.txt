 <p> Kale, quinoa, fibre, oils, fish, proper sleep, etc etc. You've probably heard these things for a very long time, and obviously because we still live on the same planet which has the same kind of food and stuff and their benefits do not change every year.You'll find these tips and many more just by searching online. There is no SECRET magic ingredient or technique in here. </p>

 <p> I jut love books that focus on homeopathic remedies. As someone who can stand the after taste of fish oil, the recommendation of flaxseed was right on the money and is something I will try. I may even try sleeping on my back. Finally I got some great tips on how you can sleep on your back in comfort -- its just a matter of using the pillows the right way. The Author is very detailed and comprehensive even though the book is a concise read. A DO Recommend!! </p>

 <p> Author Seho Song doesn't share her background so we are left to understand that this is a writer who is genuinely concerned (and knowledgeable about nutrition. The book is very short and Song makes the points brief and memorable. The driving force is the concept that diet pills and supplements and cosmetic surgery are not the answer for avoiding the aging of the body and its integument. The secret is in eating correctly.Healthy foods are vegetables and fruits, the highly nutritious ones being blueberries, leafy green vegetables, tomatoes and carrots, all of which protect the cells of the body, preventing free radicals from harming them. They also provide zinc, carotene, and vitamin C. Other foods in this family are discussed with the specific end target of their healthy effect. Such healthy elements as reservatrol, hyaluronic acid an their sources have been proven to erase fine lines in the skin. Other families of foods that are beneficial include whole grains, fish (salmon, sardines), dairy foods (especially yogurt), nuts, beans and lentils, tofu, cinnamon. Once the good foods are discussed thoroughly, the foods to avoid forma chapter - foods high in fat, salt, sugar.Song talks specifically about skin care through diet as well as topical care. Then come the meal plans for a seven day course - each meal of each day is discussed along with the benefits of each of the ingredients. The importance of sleep and of maintaining the balance of good bacteria (probiotics) rounds out the nutrition course Seho Song offers.There is nothing strange or new about what the author describes, but it is the terse and digestible manner in which the book is written that makes it well worth keeping around as a constant reminder of the importance of diet and anti-aging.

 <p> The Anti-Aging Diet Secret is a great resource for those of us who just want the facts without all the fluff and lingo that goes with most diet self-help texts. The author is clear and concise.  Information is relevant, doable, and practical.  This is a wonderful book to &#34;get to the point&#34; of the matter to reverse the aging process.The core of this book is to inform the reader that vitamins, pharmaceuticals, and manipulatives do not get to the source for the cure of the aging process. Solutions for reversal are practical and &#34;delicious.&#34; The author stresses that consuming healthy food is the basis of maintaining one's youth naturally.  Best of all, healthy foods are listed with the benefits of each when it becomes part of your daily diet.A special bonus includes skin care and a seven day meal plan for a great beginning to a youthful and healthy jump-start to develop your own plan.Highly recommended. </p>
