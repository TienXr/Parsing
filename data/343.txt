<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> I really loved this story, and the characters in this story. I have all of Ronica Black's books. I would suggest this book or any of her books. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> some awesome erotica blighted by weak characterization </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> Ignore Amazon's print length listing of 288 pages.  I have the paperback and it's a mere 186 pages (starting on p. 11).  I really hate how often I find these page errors on Amazon and I'm not sure why authors do nothing to correct this.  Well at least it's more accurate at the Bold Strokes Books website at 192 pages... I guess they count the ads at the end.I was hesitant to read a third book by this author because I pretty much slammed the last two and I don't follow authors just to be mean.  I repeat authors I love or have hope for.  And I like the way Ronica Black thinks.  Her ideas around power play are really sexy to me.  But so far I have great difficulty liking her characters because they are poorly developed or just plain mean and stupid.  There was some sexy sex here and I loved the IDEA of these leads, but I was much too distracted by how emotionally ridiculous they both behaved to truly enjoy them outside the bedroom.  And with the exception of Fran (who seduced me with the leg-crossing commentary), I thought all the secondary characters here should be shot. Twice!Professor Jude Jaeger is a proper academic by day as the department head of foreign languages.  By night she is the tall, blonde, leather-clad top at Conquest...  a kinky sex club in town.  She takes her women- they don't touch her. This reserved German lesbian doesn't like much talk either and she is not emotionally available.  When innocent little Mary (as in Mary *is* a little lamb) finds herself alone at the bar as the result of a dirty trick by her colleagues, she becomes instant prey.  Claimed by Jude, she helplessly submits and finds herself stripped and deflowered three different ways with a strap-on by the hottest top at the club.Sound yummy?  Sure was.  The opening chapters are hot enough- the hottest in the book.But then they left the bedroom.  Apparently the sex is so great, it's mad love.  lol.  Suddenly these two have some kind of anxiety disorder and can barely function unless they can be together again.  Jude is in weepy denial and Mary starts to behave like a little stalker.  Their behavior was just too much.  Like, melodramatic overacting.  And then suddenly they recover and change into different and better people receptive to love.  Now that's some powerful sex, lol.  No real character development... just magic.  If that doesn't shrivel your libido, the a-holes who work with Mary certainly will.  Now I didn't hate these leads or find them mean to each other as I did in the other novels I've read by this author... but all of Mary's colleagues have that mean-spirited element I just couldn't stand.  They all bully the shy and introverted Mary and behave like it's junior high.  They are obviously young, though no one's age is ever mentioned... and I've worked with some 20somethings who really are this stupid and mean, but it just comes off as a simple-minded conflict device on the page.  I know it's erotica or an erotic-romance... but must the characters be so dumb???  Ack.I had a good laugh at this weird interlude where Jude ends up in the boxing ring playing out some lesbo top-on-top Brokeback Mountain fight scene, lol... what was that???  LOL.  Kind of hot in the end, but what a random and poorly integrated plant to show she's frustrated.  And Mary transforms in the broom closet at work... kind of like Superman. Suddenly The Virgin Mary is The Assertive Slut.  Huh?  lol.  Love the virgin/whore contrast, but it wasn't very believable here. Plus I preferred Jude as the big bad virgin-stealing wolf (and it'd be nice if she knew more English than "I cannot") with Mary as her little lamb.  I also thought the last chapter shoulda been deleted altogether.I don't know.  Read it for the sex.  It's hot.  Keep it on your nightstand for Chapters 2-3 alone, lol.  I actually bought this like two years ago and thought the writing was so bad I couldn't get past the opening. Had very little experience with romances and erotica.  I may be harsh on lesfic now, but my standards have actually lowered by leaps and bounds and I enjoy stuff now that I couldn't read for 5 minutes when I first started reading this genre.  Patience, please.  I'm working on my lobotomy.  I've heard this is one of the better examples of this author's work... </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Totally stunning and worth multiple hosannas! </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> This book covered new territory for me and that always tickles my fancy. In addition, the way the two main characters grow, face their qualms, and astoundingly blast through their trepidations, constraints, and inhibitions had me grabbing on to anything to keep my own equilibrium. I was constantly bowled over and baffled at what happened next for one gal and then the other. I not only tip my hat to Ronica Black, but I will get down on my knees, throw my arms to the skies, and sing multiple hosannas. Totally stunning!Mary Brunelle's workmates seem to have invited her out for drinks. That is not what they really planned. They have actually set her up for a most unusual experience. What her colleagues don't get to realize until several weeks later, is that they handed her a ticket to her ultimate freedom and a big time sexual awakening. There was no way for me to possibly predict the extraordinary blossoming that happens to Mary along with the growth of an amazing pair of cojones helping her grab her world and bring it to its knees. I salute you Mary!Jude Jaeger is initially a very mysterious and potent individual. Mary meets her for the first time, compliments of her workmates' set-up.  Jude is a powerhouse with a monstrously large pain tearing apart her innards that she has managed to bury under layers and layers of impenetrable control. She is extraordinary and initially dwarfs Mary while mesmerizing her. How these two jostle to maintain their power centers, regain their control, or burst forth from ugly shackles that have relentlessly locked them into dismal and bleak prisons frankly blew my mind to the ends of the universe.I hope I have made my point about how completely amazing this story is. It isn't easy to read, but unless you are holding onto your sanity by the skin of your teeth, this is a must read that I totally recommend.NOTE: This book was provided by Bold Strokes Books for the purpose of a review on Rainbow Book Reviews. </p>

 <p> reads more like erotica than prose but gloriously hot. after reading it quickly, it at times felt like a long graphic lovemaking scene with slight characterization.  pleasurable escape </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I have not read this genre of lesbian fiction. It is raw, edgy and designed to stimulate. My only wish is there had been more character development, as this book has an interesting plot. The characters are rather two-dimensional. Even for this genre, fully-formed characters would really enhance this book and make it more interesting. Other reviewers have pointed out this flaw as well. But if you want a quick, easy bedtime, prelude-to-passion read, this is your book. </p>

 <p> 4.5 Stars for What It Is </p>

<h2> REVIEW TEXT </h2>

 <p> I didn't/don't plan on becoming a "reviewer", but I felt the need to share my thoughts on this one.  So many books I love have few to no review which as an AVID reader, makes it difficult to narrow down and find something that I would really want, particularly in my preferred genres.  I figure that maybe if more of us took the time to come back and give a review, it would help others in their search and let the authors and publishers know that they are appreciated.  I'd also like to think the writers check in once in a while to get feedback from their audience to help improve the next story by trying to give us more of what we want.I bought and read this book last weekend, and I have re-read it one and a half more times since then.  (The third time I just scanned through to the juicy parts-which didn't require a lot of scanning as the whole thing is SIZZLIN' HOT.)  Having recently read Radclyffe's Shadowland (& LUV'D IT!) has put me in a mood for less Vanilla stuff here lately.  Although this story isn't dark like Shadowland, it's pretty intense and definitely satisfied my fix for the time being.  The previous reviewer gave a really good description of the plot so I won't, but I will say that my ONLY complaint about this is book was the length.  It is more like a novella.  IDK how many pages it equates to, but the furthest location is 2965.  I wanted to know more (I ALWAYS want to know more-it's just my nature).  I wanted to know what happened to Jude & Mary that lead them to the places in their lives they were each in when they met (Jude-the hard, unemotional & untouchable top and Mary-the introverted, inexperienced/underexperienced ing&eacute;nue).  I also wanted to see more progression of both characters.  Especially Mary's.  Seems like she just got balls all of a sudden and started standing up to her co-workers and taking more care with her appearance, but we don't see those traits develop in her.  She just evolves into a new person virtually overnight.  This would have been a 5 star story in my book if it were about (& again, I am only guestimating since I don't know the actual conversion rate) 50 pages longer with more character development details.  For what it is however, a story meant to entertain and stimulate, it definitely gets the job done.  I recently discovered this author and have also read Wild Abandon and In Too Deep-both of which were Awesome, and I look forward to reading the rest of her catalog.I will leave on this note...  that first scene between Jude & Mary--WOW!!!  Friggin WOWWW!!!!  It alone was worth the purchase price.  That scene accounts for like the first ten percent of the book, and OMG it will definitely kick up your heartrate and breathing.  I don't have a "keeper shelf", but if I did...  So long and Happy Reading!! </p>

 <p> Fantastic book that is not only amazingly hot but a good story about coming to terms with what we want and who we are. It's a really well written story and fun to read.  I can't wait to read more of Ms. Black 's work. </p>

 <p> This incredibly erotic lesbian novel grabbed me at the first sentence and did not let go, even after THE END.It is my favorite of all her erotic books, although In Too Deep runs a close second.She is a master at providing a very vivid picture with words.  Mary and Jude are such amazing women.  I'd love to meet them in real life.tcbeachbum47 </p>

 <p> Jude Jaeger has a room in the Conquest Club she uses for pleasuring women. She is a lesbian and is not interested in having a relationship. She wants women for one thing only, to give them the pleasure and passion they can't get elsewhere and with no strings attached. This works out fine for Jude until she meets Mary Brunelle one evening. Mary isn't like all the other women Jude pleasures and Jude finds herself reacting to Mary in ways she didn't think was possible. Mary is shy and a loner. She had gone to Conquest after being set up by some work acquaintances. But Mary finds herself in Jude's arms having the hottest sex of her life. Mary is desperate to meet up with Jude again and leaves numerous messages at the club which all go unanswered. One evening when Mary is in her language class, she sees Jude again. She is there in her official capacity of the Professor overseeing Mary's class. Mary is now more determined than ever to pursue Jude again, no matter what the consequences. Meanwhile, Jude is battling with her own feelings towards Mary. She can't let go of her past though. She can't become involved with Mary just to suffer more pain and hurt. Will the two women be able to get beyond sex to have a relationship? Will they even meet up for sex anymore or will Jude be strong enough to say no?This book is so hot, it's smoking and smouldering throughout. The book is fairly short, but very sweet and has a really nice story to it. So, if you like hot with a story and loveable characters, take this to the beach. Make sure you take a tent though! </p>

 <p> So I'll be honest - best erotic sex scenes you can get.  This is not for the faint of heart. If you don't like your sex scenes graphic, then this is not the book for you.  The charachter developement leaves a little to be desired.  Both women make an emotional 180 a little too fast, but if I were having that kind of sex, maybe I would too.I love Ronica Black.  If you are looking for a longer novel that has great character developement, a compelling crime plotline and is sexy as well, check out "In Too Deep". </p>
