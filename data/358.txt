 <p> This was an enjoyable read, I like Becca Van's Pack Law series very much. They are similar in that there are multiple men with women that need help and are running from some kind of big bad. I like the interactions between the characters and I really like that Aly was feisty in this book and stood up to her mates. </p>

 <p> Title:  Love Found  - Book Six of the Pack Law SeriesAuthor:  Becca VanShifter, MenageSynopsis:Rylan, Tarkyn and Chevy Freiss,  Omegas in the Freiss pack are finding it harder and harder to be happy for the mated members of their pack.  They want a mate of their own,  but  are beginning to think it will never happen when suddenly a delicious smell draws them down the steps to a delivery truck.  Alyson Redding is hiding from a madman and  trying  to survive.  A new town,  a new job, and a resolve to stay away from emotional entanglements.  Little does she know her life is about to change forever.The Freiss brothers do not know how  they are  going to get the innocent,  frightened  young woman they recognise as their mate to trust them.  They know she is attracted to them, but that she is fighting them.  The dominant personalities of the three brothers raises the temper of their fiesty mate and she fights them at every turn.  Alyson soon learns not to challenge a wolf.  They are not afraid to accept the challenge, nor do they not back down.Review:The latest brothers are lowly omegas in the Freiss pack and feel unworthy of a mate.  When they find Alyson, they find she is running from a madman who wants information only she has.  They pack her off to the Pack house to keep her safe.  They want her to be proud of them, but more than that they want her to accept them as her mates.  Experience has shown Alyson nust because a man says he loves someone doesn't mean he treats her with respect and love.  She is running from a man who blames her for his loss of social position and his family.  He plans to find her an make her pay for her interfernce.Along the path of true love these four souls have a lot to learn about each other.  Trust is the first thing on the agenda.  Especially when Alyson learns the three hot guys she is attracted to are werewolves and that they want to claim her as their mate.  Rylan, Tarkyn and Chevy have to stay on their toes to keep Alyson safe and teach her how the  heiarchy  of pack life works.  Alyson, fiesty and independant soul that she is needs to learn that sometimes it is okay to lean on someone and that not all men are abusive.  Follow  along  as they work to resolve their issues.
