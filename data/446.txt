 <p> I am a firm believer in getting fit and this book has some really great exercise tips. What better workout can you do besides one that is tailored for a Navy Seal? I will definitely be adding some of these workout tips. </p>

 <p> The author begins with an easy to understand explanation of the different types of training. Then proceeds with outline of different types of exercises. I would have liked them to be explained in a step-by-step method...but maybe that is just an indication of my learning style.The author provides links to a comprehensive set of resource.This book would be good for someone who wants to be a "weekend SEAL" </p>

 <p> If you are looking to get in fit then this book will help you do just that. The Navy Seals have long been the top fit people and they stay fit because of the training they received. Great guide. </p>

 <p> This "book" is about 10 pages of slightly reworded public domain material lifted from an excellent workout guide that can be found on the official Navy SEAL website. ([...])It contains nothing original and has links to public domain videos on Youtube. I don't expect much from a $2.99 book, but this one was obviously thrown together in a hurry.For a book that contains solid Navy SEAL-type workouts, consider this book by Mark Divine:8 Weeks to SEALFITand this one by Stew Smith:The Complete Guide to Navy SEAL Fitness, Revised Edition.Not recommended - BUYER BEWARE! </p>

 <p> Disappointing - Buyer Beware! </p>

 <p> Navy SEALs Training by Rob Goyette is about the physical preparation for BUD/S. It is a 26 week program designed to get you prepped for the world's elite Navel Special Warfare (NSW) training. It consists of a lot of public domain information and links which is not a big deal because the information is relevant. One drawback to the book is that is fails to really cover the mental aspect. Being in great physical condition is one aspect that does not guarantee passing all the phases of SEAL training. An excellent book that is complementary to this one isBecome a U.S. Navy SEALwhich covers a lot of information that is not covered in this book. </p>
