 <p> Singular story about a woman looking for feathers and an expedition of people looking for paradise in a valley which is not drawn on the map. So, they suppose paradise must be there, obscured by clouds. A hippy philosophy but with a touch of scepticism. A picture of the late 70's with a beautiful photography by Nestor Almendros. </p>

 <p> I first saw this back in the seventies. I can't remember what I thought of it then but having just seen it for the first time since then, I can sum this up in only two words - boring and pretentious. It is an "art house" movie for sure but one whose aspirations extend far too far beyond its reach.I'm left numb but not comfortably. I was going to say "it features" but it doesn't. It just HAS some music by the Pink Floyd. The soundtrack, such as it is, is utterly irrelevant; it might have benefitted from Tangerine Dream or Faust or some such. As it goes, whatever qualities the music has are left far behind as it's barely audible anyway. Even out of context, the music's dull.Yawn. </p>

 <p> Last year I set out to get my hands on the film, &quot;More&quot; (another Barbet Schoeder film) because the CD was great.  Then I came across my very old CD &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot;.  So wouldn't you know, I just had to get a copy of &quot;La Vallee&quot; despite, the not-so-great reviews.&quot;La Vallee&quot;, in my view, is better then &quot;More&quot;, and certainly not as dismal.  A rich diplomats wife, Vivian played by Bulle Ogier, is a restless &quot;closet&quot; hell raiser, who happens to have money to play with. She goes in search of a rare birds exotic and very beautiful feathers, and very illegal too.  She comes across a group of hippies also looking for &quot;a better way&quot; but they will not sell her the feathers, but they do invite her to join their little expetition to &quot;The Valley&quot;. However, Vivian is warned that they may not come back...  Together they meet many different tribesman, mudmen, birdmen..you get the point.  They also don't seem to give a damn about commiting adultry...  After a long journey into the rain forest, they all get discouraged, tired, and hungry.  One man says, if you listen towards the end of the film, &quot;Ya know, we're never going to make it there.&quot;  The other man replies, &quot;we must keep going.&quot;  Now, you never actually see this valley, but right at the end of the film, Vivan says while pointing, &quot;There it is, I see it.&quot;  -Fin-  Yeah, and we never really know if they are all just delirious or high, or really there...  This is a nice film, a rather boring and dry during the last hour or so; excellent score by Pink Floyd - which is the only reason I honestly purchased this-filmed beautifully in a rainforest of New Guinea.  BUT, WHERE'S THE VALLEY?! </p>

 <p> Opening scene: Vivian, a diplomats wife, is browsing through the artifacts offered for sale in a grass hut in New Guinea. Vivian is seeking some rare feathers that fetch huge sums at Parisian Boutiques. She is a socialite and yet she is also very comfortable in the very earthy surroundings she finds herself in while her husband is away on business. At first hers seems only a casual curiousity but then in walks a tall blonde hippie stranger who has just returned from the interior with a cache of rare feathers -- after that it is not only feathers she is interested in but the tall blonde stranger as well.Vivian catches a ride with the stranger and accompanies him back to his camp site. As soon as the two enter the tent they see a couple laying naked together. Vivian is surprised and yet also turned on by these very relaxed living conditions. The hippies live very close to the earth and they want to get even closer. In this very sensually open atmosphere the blonde stranger shows Vivian where they intend to go -- it is a place which has no name because it has never been charted as it is invisible from the sky as it is perpetually obscured by clouds. To the hippies this last unmarked place represents a last promise of paradise. Vivian is skeptical of such notions but she cannot resist the heady atmosphere of dreaminess and sensual freedom that this group represents to her and so she decides to leave her socialite existence for awhile and accompany them to La Vallee.The story is very simple and Barbet Schroeder's style is almost documentary simple --  Schroeder produced some of the early new wave films but his own films are nothing like those early 1960's films. More and La Vallee do not draw attention to the director as the new wave films did, Schroeders films concentrate on the vagaries of character and what different experiences feels like. The Pink Floyd soundtrack does more than the dialogue in giving us access to what these characters are going through. Though they are united in their search for paradise, each character is also on a very private journey and  the music accents both the shared and private aspects of this cross country quest.One of the most memorable sequences is when the group spends the day with several tribes of New Guinea bushmen who have gathered to recognize their ancestors. Two of the hippies dress in tribal attire and paint themselves and dance along with the tribesman but two do not. Vivian herself does not adorn herself but merely watches the goings-on from a comfortable distance like a journalist  while the tall blonde stranger feels a deep depression that he unlike the tribesman will never feel at one with nature.  At another point Vivian too will attempt to merge with nature with the help of a hallucinogen but it is only a momentary  union.  And so the film is dreamy and yet also it is a kind of lament that certain dreams will never be more than dreams.Along with the subtle but perfect mood music by Pink Floyd the cinematography is absolutely exquisite -- New Guinea has never looked so good.I like both More and La Vallee equally well.  And yes Michelangelo Antonio's Zabriskie Point is also very good and also features Pink Floyd as well as the Grateful Dead. I think Barbet Schroeder's films are much more organic though and so more pleasing to the instincts than Antonioni's film. Antonioni is very intellectual and even when he gets organic he arrives there by intellectual routes.  Herzogs Aguirre is excellent and it is similar in that it is also a search for a mythic paradise but its vision of nature and man is much harsher.  Theres a lyric magic in Barbet Schroeders films that simply does not exist anywhere else. </p>

 <p> Quick rundown on the narrative, as not to sound too repetitive: Rich woman, wife of a diplomat and clothing designer, seeks rare bird feathers and native art. She meets an Aussie man who, along with another man, two women, and a young boy, are seeking a valley (the title) where they will find utopia (I guess). As they move closer to this valley, she begins to sever ties with her social/bourgeoise life, and sheds any material needs. The group is found to be "hippies" by her, and she succumbs to their seemingly inane search for "the valley."As I watched this movie, I was reminded of Werner Herzog's "Aguirre: The Wrath of God" (did I say that?!?!). However, Herzog's movie is cinematic genius; Schroeder lacks the same great narrative ability. The shots and ethnographic footage is similar (meeting natives in foggy landscapes), but Herzog "became" the film (if you have seen Les Blank's documentary "Burden of Dreams," then you understand what I am describing). This movie relies too much on toeing a line between being an ethnographic movie and a narrative of the time it was made. I believe it fails in both ways, but not as badly as to render the film absolutely awful. I liked it to a point, taking it in as a "period piece" (in the vein of a movie like "Glen and Randa" or "Zabriskie Point") than for face-value. After all, it is about shedding one's pretentious ways for a greater aim. However, it is a bit long and over-winded.The music by Pink Floyd seemed more for a gimmick (to sell the movie) than to give a greater level to the narrative. The film is made like a documentary, but most of what happens is not shocking or really all that imaginative. The constant use of Australians using French seems really crazed! Is every "white" person in New Guinea Australian who speak fluent French? The movie also "feels" like it should have been made some 5 years BEFORE release. By 1972, I tend to believe that this movie would already have seemed dated.The DVD, by HVE, has some problems. The greatest I found is that there are a couple of scenes in the transfer where one can see the film "skip." The filmstrip is noticeable, with sprocket holes and all! Wow. I don't know why.The "greens" of New Guinea, along with the misty mountains (reminiscent of Herzog's "Aguirre") are beautiful (obviously, with Nestor Almendros' cinematography). I enjoyed the ethnographic imagery and of rites and dances of the natives. For someone interested in them, this film is worth a look.3 of 5 Amazon stars. I take 1/2 off for the DVD transfer. It is, nevertheless, an interesting view, but many will probably be bored by some overlong scenes. The movie could truly have been better with 30 or so minutes trimmed. </p>

 <p> This movie was purchased as part of a collection of Pink Floyd works. This one being slightly more tasteful than Z-point. however most of it's in French, so Sub-titles, for me was important. Still the over all theme left me only thinking of the sound tract. </p>

 <p> ...coming after the brilliant MEDDLE, this album posed a problem for Floyd... they were tired of being a Euro "Cult" band in the US, and needed to start racking up sales-after all 'the '60's' were over with. So it came to pass that OBSCURED BY CLOUDS would be the last 'honest' Floyd LP, though because of the constraints placed on them for an OST, I find it to be a rather lackluster album...but it started their slide from artistic purity to commercial $uccess-yes im talking about every post-pubescent boys wet dream, finally radio friendly to corporate owned FM stations-and still on the charts after 30 years,  the mediocre, but trillion-selling DARK SIDE OF THE MOON...(just because it sells tonnes dont mean its any good) Oh... the film was OK... </p>

 <p> I first saw LA VALLEE over two decades ago and was haunted by the exotic images and Pink Floyd's score.  Eventually, I molded a memory that in fact was quite different from the actual film. In hindsight, it wouldn't surprise me if that was director Barbet Schroeder's intent.  Certainly the cinematography by Nestor Almendros serves that purpose.This meandering, mystical and somewhat pretentious hippie trek into the wilds of Borneo to find rare bird feathers is meant to be a journey of self-discovery -- a  cinematic acid trip that may or may not have actual meaning.Oddly, in the movie, the &quot;Valley Obscured by Clouds&quot; (the film's full title) is never reached, but only seen in the distance at fade out.Pink Floyd's music and the exotic images make it worth the trek.  But beware of seeing this in an altered state hoping to improve the quality of the trip. </p>

 <p> Somebody can explain the difference between real dog fights being videotaped----and the scene in this movie where a poor real pig gets its head smashed in.This french movie in which jungle natives kill a pig probably was ripped off by francis coppola, for APOCALYPSE NOW, in which jungle natives kill a water buffalo.And there's also the '60s hippie/Black Panthers/Charlie Manson lingo of pigs = cops, so dig the symbolism!  Wow, that's groovy, and deep.Even forgetting that bit of intellectual/artistic cruelity to animals, there isn't much to this movie, beyond some good photography and some ancient pink floyd music.Nothing special about the actors, or dialogue, or even the few seconds of nudity.  And the plot is soooo 60s/70s, with some petite bougeize into the jungle to find some feather and the meaning of life, man.If you like real dog fights or cock fights, you could buy this and fast forward to the pig slaughter scene, mon amie. </p>

 <p> I saw THE VALLEY (Obscured By Clouds) in a theater in the 70s, though probably not on its first-run engagement. What I remember is the imagry, not the music (in hindsight I'm startled Pink Floyd supplied the mostly subtle score), and an awe for the film and an appreciation for the night on walking out of the theater. I remember the ad campaign, but it was a word-of-mouth hit -- "You HAVE to see this movie!"Much of the content is dated to its times, but a surprising portion is not. Remember, too, that the term "hippie" was itself getting dated in 1972, the pursuit of personal pleasures rising, as one bit of dialogue touches on.The DVD transfer is imperfect, but artifacts are not obtrusive. Some of the editing is abrupt, again not detracting from the whole. The film is largely in French with some English and native New Guinean; English subtitles are available, but only accessible by pressing the Subtitles button on the player or remote.As with most art-house films, THE VALLEY is aimed at an adult audience. Contained are full-frontal nudity (both genders), sex, and the frank killing and slaughter of three pigs, as well as themes of sensuality, monogamy, societal rigidity, and natural mood-altering substances. </p>
