 <p> I have been needing a new cable for well over a year and a half, but had not been able to purchase it due to high price ranges.. Back when beats was with Monster cable, they were charging me $60 for this same cable.. So Glad I got it at this price! Paid less than $5.00. They work like a Charm!!! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> These works outstanding </p>

 <p> they are high quality, and are exactly like the one that came with my beats originally. I don't think that they are authentic however, and I believe they are mock ups </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> It's a stereo cable alright. </p>

 <p> Perhaps I misunderstood. I thought it was an actual Monster Priducts made cable. It isn't. The cable lacks the soft, suppleness of the original stereo cable that came with the headphones. This replacement cable is thick and stiff.I actually still have my original cable, but I bought this because I liked the idea that the 1/4&#34; adapter was tethered to the cable because I lost mine. Well, the tether is just a flimsy rubber bungee that I'm certain will break if put to the test.Oh well  I guess I have a cable that I can leave behind plugged in my sound board while I take my headphones with me to enjoy w/ my MO player. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Good cable </p>

 <p> This cord is easily as good as the original cord that came with my set of Beats Pro headphones. I can see or hear no difference in quality. </p>

 <p> I was having trouble with the original cord on my Beats by Dre (Detox Edition). With the purchase of this cord I'm not having any trouble with my headphones. I can actually hear out of BOTH headphones now! </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Better than the Original </p>

 <p> Bought these to replace my original Beats Pro cable and they fit nicely! Would be again if needed, but looks like they will last longer than the original ones. </p>
