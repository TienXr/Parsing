 <p> The book is very straightforward, very concise and direct with no jokes, padding, or nonsense. I'd consider this a good introduction for someone with limited programming experience who desires a quick intro to the very basics of Javascript programming because it covers all the essentials in a way that is clear and concise. The author has written this in such a way that it doesn't overload or confuse someone with minimal knowledge of Javascript. If you need a very good and easy to understand intro book then I thoroughly recommend this one. Because of this book, I am now more proficient with Javascript and have a much clearer understanding of how it works. </p>

 <p> I have been wanting to create my own web page but I am not knowledgeable enough to make one.  This book has taught me the basics in programming and web development.  The author made it sure the information is understandable to the general audience.  As a novice myself, I can start creating my page after reading the book. </p>

 <p> I am looking to start working on my own website, and will be hiring a programmer but i wanted the ability to talk &#34;shop&#34; with them too.This book is clearly laid out and I already have a good grasp on how the language works in one sitting. I am really looking forward going through this thoroughly to improve my understanding of this language. </p>

 <p> I think anyone who buys this book has at least basic knowledge of computers, the internet, and a webpage. If you want to learn programming and become adept at html and web development, this is for you. However, don&#8217;t expect being spoon fed, this book makes it clear at the very beginning that it aims to guide and help. The bigger part of learning is up to the person&#8217;s motivation and efforts to learn. I had basic html knowledge, thanks to our advance computer programming subject back in high school but most of what I learned, I have already forgotten. It feels good to read them again here. This is like taking a crash refresher course. Some codes are new to me so I must say I got plenty of things learned from this book. Understand though that the author&#8217;s approach is not the only approach to html and programming (refer to introduction) so in the event you become better at this, you&#8217;ll get what that means. What this book offers are simplified programming approaches. Amazed at how informative this is! </p>

 <p> This book does a great job on explaining javascript programming, especially for beginners like me. It's short and concise and not so overwhelming like many other few-hundred pages manuals that you lose yourself in. What stands out is that you can apply your knowledge right away with exercises on the publishers online-page, simply great! </p>

 <p> I've gone through several HTML 4 and 5 as well as CSS3 books and although they've taught me a lot, it was a bit challenging to go through them from start to finish as they were way too long.  This book I found to be the perfect length on javascript.  I've tried to pick up JavaScript in the past but just dropped it out of sheer boredom.  Not so in this book.  The author cuts to the chase and hits the important fundamentals to get you coding.  Recommended for those looking for a quick and thorough approach to JavaScript. </p>

 <p> Great follow up to HTML! </p>

 <p> I've spent several years making my own websites with html and css templates. However JavaScript was something that I had not yet learned. This book was great in helping me to learn JavaScript basics without overwhelming me with technical jargon. I also liked that I could keep it with me next to my computer as I went through each step. The engaging writing style also kept me from getting bored :). Great starter guide for beginners. </p>
