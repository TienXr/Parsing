 <p> I&#8217;ve been pretty stressed lately with work, so I gave this book a read. It was very refreshing and reminded me I need to take time for myself, as well as focusing on tasks to be done. Simply reading the book reinforced this for me, and I&#8217;m certain through doing this I will get more done! Overall, a superb book! </p>

 <p> This is little book starts off with the triad of Productivity, Play and Prize - which, in my opinion is very important. Many productivity books talk about tips and techniques on how to be productive, and often neglect the importance of &#34;play&#34; (rest and restoration) and &#34;prize&#34; - the sense of accomplishment or fulfillment. In this book, the author asked 3 important questions related to productivity - &#34;What&#34;, &#34;How&#34; and &#34;When&#34; and provide useful tips on avoiding distractions! Chapter 6 (the final chapter) provides a succinct summary of all the steps and techniques discussed in this book. Thumbs up! </p>

 <p> Right after seeing the title, I felt like this book was written for me. This is just the right read I need at this time of my life. I can&#8217;t seem to find balance in my personal life and work. Work seems so eat up all my time yet I don&#8217;t feel the fulfillment I&#8217;m entitled to feel. And I have to say I enjoyed reading this book and find the chapter &#8220;Preparations Against Procrastination&#8221; really helpful. The idea of setting a timer to focus on tasks at hand is refreshing and I think would work for me. This book talks about setting priorities and knowing which category the tasks you're working on fall. This is where I fall short so I need to keep this in mind.This book is worth buying and recommending! </p>

 <p> This book is one of the most comprehensive guide on how to be productive and have a balanced life. I especially like the chapter one and six, where author explains about concept of productivity, play, and prize, and there is chapter 6 (relax, rest, and recovery). These are very informative tips and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to boost on productivity. </p>

 <p> I read a lot of &#34;productivity tips&#34; type books, but this one really knocked my socks off. It's short and concise and, the author doesn't feel the need to repeat himself eighteen million times in every chapter she writes. It's really, really to the point. Yes, it's a quick and simple read, but every chapter is full of quick and brilliant ideas. I'm a total nerd, so I actually took notes while reading it, and can't wait to put some of my notes into action and try a bit of habit formation - I'm really excited to get going with all of these ideas. I've tried a few already and they've had really positive impacts, so I have very high hopes for implementing the rest of Kayla Roxas ideas and systems. I highly recommend this book. </p>
