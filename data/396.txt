 <p> Oscar Wilde said, &#34;Great genius is the ability to make the complicated simple, not the other way around.&#34; Ernest Holmes makes understanding the great questions of life, simple.As a life time student of the Bible, I find Holmes provides a simple way to understand it, finally.We are responsible to work with God, and Holmes shows in simple terms how to do it.Other thinkers use Holmes work as a source material.This book has changed my life for the better, and continues to change it as I refer back to it for guidance when confused.It can do the  same thing for you. </p>

 <p> A lifetime resource manual.  Great for those who desire a deeper understanding of HOW Spirituality works in our lives as well as those who are metaphysically experienced.  Provides a solid foundation for Spiritual practice.  This work links the core of ALL religious values. </p>

 <p> I was amazed with the clear explanation Holmes gives in the Science of Mind about why a mental treatment works. I have read other books in metaphysics, which I enjoyed; but I found clearer the Science of Mind teaching method to neutralize the effect of negative thoughts. </p>

 <p> Excellent </p>

 <p> This is a lesson in truth book.  I recommend it for those who are searching for the truth about themselves and that is the only truth.  This is a study book, not a sit down and read book.  The Science of Mind Church is based on the findings of Ernest Holmes and this book.  You can study it with a group, or you can read it and study it alone. </p>

 <p> This is a very good study book for those searching for the truth about themselves, and I think that is the only truth. </p>

 <p> This book is informative and applicable. It shares ideas and examples of how a person can stay positive, make wise decisions, and develop effective communication skills. I enjoyed the format of the chapters. Of course, this book isn't as deep as "a crossing or the drop's history" by Anatoliy Obraztsov what I've read before and, in fact, I prefer deep books. But I rated "The Science of Mind" 5! Each chapter expresses an idea and gives an example from the author's life, an example from research or scientific authority, and an example from the Bible. The information is clear and easy to read, yet causes the reader to reflect and ponder new ideas. It motivates change and improvement. </p>

 <p> This is one of the greatest books I have read in a long time. It cuts right to the heart of things. You will realize everything you ever wanted to know spiritually. I have shared this with friends of mine and they agree. It's a book that once you start reading, you will not want to put down. I love it. </p>

 <p> I already own a hard copy, but I would rather not lug it around. Now I don't have to. I can just reach for my iPhone or iPad with kindle loaded onto it and voila! I have Mr. Holmes at my beck and call whenever I want it. </p>

 <p> Great reference to maintain on your e-reader! </p>

 <p> I have had the hard cover of this book for over 15 years and only read it when the Kindle version came out. The principles in this book are timeless even if you don't share a belief system with Dr. Holmes. With the heavy media conditioning everyone faces, instructions on how to get back to a fundamental place in your thinking is imperative. </p>

 <p> Ageless principles </p>
