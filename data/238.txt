<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> A deadly yo yo throwing girl goes undercover at a high school in an attempt to stop a terrorist organization. The lead actress has the charisma, and time is spent developing some of the characters. The action is few and far between, but suddenly the pace explodes as the viewer is treated to a laudably creative schoolgirl yo yo duel to the death. A showdown between the yo yo girl and half a dozen heavily armed madmen quickly follows. The score (especially the theme song) is excellent. Finally a schoolgirl fight movie worth watching.To elaborate on my summary paragraph above, let's do a quick contrast between Sukeban Deka: Kodo Nemu Asamiya Saki (aka Yo Yo Girl Cop) with the much touted and highly overrated Hollywood epic 300. While they are two very different films in terms of storyline and setting, they are both firmly fixed within the encompassing genre of Action.That said, the action in Sukeban Deka is far superior to anything seen in 300 in terms of choreography. I never knew there were so many ways to use a steel yo yo to capacitate an enemy - straight shots, arm wraps, floor bounces, object manipulation, etc. 300 showed us nothing we haven't seen before in terms of choreography, because it focused (too much) on photographic tricks rather than on weapon movements, which makes the experience tiring and repetitive. Such repetition can be avoided in two fundamental ways: exceptional diversity of choreography (e.g., Tom Yum Goong) and situational excellence (e.g., Sky High). 300 has neither, but Sukeban Deka uses the latter, because the first 75 minutes are used to set up the 15 minute finale.Now, there's nothing particularly groundbreaking in terms of the general storyline or dramatic elements, but they do provide a series of effective anti-climaxes that taunt the viewer into doubting the existence of a grand finale. This is a good technique because when the showdown between the two schoolgirls finally makes its appearance, the excitement and intensity is enhanced due to the character interaction that preceded it. This makes for interesting comparisons to 300, which has almost no intensity whatsoever since antagonists are introduced mere seconds prior to getting slaughtered - which explains why critics get bored DURING the battle scenes in 300. A major "no no" for an action film.It took me two viewings to come to these conclusions, because Sukeban Deka provides a different type of action experience that may leave the viewer in a bit of shock after an initial viewing. The opening hour may seem weak at first, but is much better following a repeated watch because the viewer - now aware of the grand finale - can appreciate the build-up even more so. This is good stuff!I now wish to respond to some IMDb comments that I find grossly inaccurate. Jmaruyama points out some obvious references to American films (i.e., 007 opening credits, Silence of the Lambs restraining mask, etc.). However, this commenter makes a major mistake in claiming that the showdown "seems like a copy of the Bride's showdown with Go-Go Yubari in Kill Bill Vol. 1." Um, huh? The fight in Kill Bill involved a sword and a meteor hammer while the fight in Sukeban Deka involved two steel yo yos. How on God's green earth are these duel's even REMOTELY similar? The only possible similarity is that a yo yo and a meteor hammer are marginally alike in structure - a blunt object at the end of a line - which means that the characters must swing or sling them in vaguely similar ways. Other than that, there is absolutely NOTHING comparable between the two scenes, so the claim that Sukeban Deka copied from Kill Bill is unwarranted. And considering how this film is a spin-off of other Sukeban Deka movies made in the 1980s makes the assertion even more ludicrous.Oobleckboy criticizes the action unsuccessfully by pointing out that the scenes are "too infrequent", but he doesn't seem to understand the concept of build-up and intensity detailed above, which more than adequately explains the infrequency of the action as a positive element. He complains that the schoolgirls are too "thin and soft", apparently expecting some butch, 200-pound lady body-builders instead. Let me go out on a limb and say that such casting would have been a really bad idea. He then claims that the editing was "quick and choppy", but he provides no specifics as to what he's referring to. I never found the editing to be overtly choppy because the timing of the cuts were all logical in that they enhanced the action. I suppose that Oobleckboy expects Japanese actresses to be able to kill someone with a yo yo at 30 yards or throw a bladed yo yo so perfectly that it barely grazes the other actress's cheek. For the rest of us who live in the real world, such cuts are expected.Make no mistake about it. Sukeban Deka requires a suspension of belief, but that's one of the reasons it's such a fun experience - another being the outrageous, over-the-top, and frequently cheesy premise. You may need to exercise a bit of patience for the first hour because the action is laid on thick and heavy at the very end, but I highly suggest you give this one a shot considering the currently pathetic state of American cinema. </p>

 <p> This was awesome. There isn't tons of action (definately not "non-stop" like the cover says...) but what there is, is great. Actually I mostly want to be a big idiot and point out the delicate theme they sometimes play is by William Shakespeare, from Twelth Night. (nasal hnnn)The words are:What is love? 'tis not hereafter;Present mirth hath present laughter;What's to come is still unsure:In delay there lies no plenty;Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,Youth's a stuff will not endure.How's that for unhelpful? Anyways, if you like manga-movies, this is alot of fun.(& though I rented this, I'm thinking of picking up a copy...) </p>

 <p> YO YO GIRL COP is the English language release title for SUKEBAN DEKA: CODENAME ASAMIYA SAKI, a 2006 Japanese movie based on the original "Sukeban Deka" series detailing the exploits of female special agents operating undercover in high school. The new film is something of a sequel to the 1985 TV series, insofar as the main character, Saki Asamiya, is presented as the daughter of the original "Sukeban Deka" (delinquent girl cop), also codenamed Saki Asamiya, and played in this film by the TV actress who played the part in 1985, Yuki Saito.What's special about this film version is the casting of four Japanese female pop singers from Hello! Project in the main roles, all of whom do extraordinary jobs. Solo artist Aya Matsuura, one of H!P's greatest talents, plays Saki, while Rika Ishikawa, formerly of Morning Musume and current lead singer of the trio, Biyuuden, plays Saki's chief antagonist, Reika Akiyama. The two girls generally display adorably sweet and sunny dispositions in their J-pop day jobs and have appeared together in games, contests and fun bits over the years on Morning Musume's TV show, "Hello Morning," but are called on here to play unrelenting tough girls, complete with climactic yo-yo battle, and do so with utmost spirit and conviction. The supporting roles of Tae and Kotomi, two girls bullied by Reika and her gang, are filled by Rika's sidekicks in Biyuuden, Yui Okada and Erika Miyoshi, both appearing in their very first film. They provide the film's emotional core by playing wounded souls whose victimization brings to the fore the criminal plot behind a website ominously named "Enola Gay" and designed to attract suicidal teens and promote a wave of suicide bombings. It's Saki's job to get to the bottom of all this and she takes the two bullied girls under her wing in a series of extremely touching scenes.The heavy melodramatic tone (which matches that of the original TV series) may put off viewers expecting a more tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top style of anime-inspired Japanese action a la CUTIE HONEY, a live-action comic book superhero spectacle from 2004. This one is much more somber and a bit slow in getting to the far-fetched fight scenes that a film like this needs. The final yo-yo battle between Aya and Rika, filmed on location in a sprawling abandoned factory in winter weather, is quite a sight to behold, but one wishes a Hong Kong action director with a more imaginative touch and greater experience with female fighters (paging Corey Yuen!), had been brought in for the action scenes.Still, if one feels sympathy for the basic situation of a damaged soul like Saki pulling herself together to serve a greater good and redeem herself by smashing a cynical plot to manipulate vulnerable teens, one can find this a reasonably gripping high school-themed thriller. And those who are already fans of Aya Matsuura and Rika Ishikawa can simply sit back and marvel at this whole new side of them.One of the great attractions of this DVD is the inclusion of a special 41-minute feature, "Yo Yo Girl Mission," which chronicles the making of the film and the process by which two endearing J-pop idols are transformed into karate-kicking bad girls and mortal enemies. One can see their normal "amiable" selves in conflict with the "menacing" behavior required of the characters, leading to frequent breakups into laughter during shooting and a charming bit at a press conference where Aya cutely chides Rika for such laughter. And when the petite and eager-to-please Aya insists on doing her own stunts and gets rigged with cables for a "wire-fu" maneuver, it just increases our high regard and admiration for her. She's also seen in a dual interview alongside Yuki Saito, who plays her mother in the film, but shares no scenes with her. The two even compare their yo-yos.Aya is heard on the soundtrack singing two songs with Miki Fujimoto, another ex-member of Morning Musume and Aya's partner in the H!P duo, GAM. </p>

 <p> Oh lord, was this ever bad. The worst acting I've ever seen. I mean Yu-Gi-Oh anime has better acting - and action. The plot is disconnected and schizophrenic, which wouldn't matter if the action were good, BUT IT'S NOT. The action is far too infrequent and disapointing. Any comparison to the exciting movie "Battle Royale" by the director's father (Kinji Fukasaku) does not stand up. </p>

 <p> I've seen the Japanese version of this with subtitles and it was an AWESOME movie.  It's got tons of action, some very humorous moments (such as when Aya nails herself in the head with her own Yo-Yo), and a great story.  Not to mention it's got the girls of our favorite J-Pop dynasty, Hello! Project.  Aya Matsuura does great as Saki Asamiya and Rika Ishikawa is absolutely gorgeous as the main villainess.  I just love that the creators took these very beautiful girls and inserted them into such a wonderful movie.  I will have this DVD for sure!  The only thing will be that it will be weird hearing other actresses doing the dubbed voices, but hey, it's still something to add to my collection:) </p>

 <p> One thing that I hate about Japanese movies being available in the U.S. is the silly way titles are localized. Yo Yo Girl Cop is a stupid title for a long running Japanese TV series called Sukeban Deka. The distributors should have left the title alone and just called it Sukeban Deka.I first saw Sukeban Deka when I met a lonely male college student back in Osaka. He wanted to practice English with me, so we went to his student apartment that had a filmsy door that looked no thicker than cardboard. Anyway, he wanted to show me a Japanese TV show from the 80's called Sukeban Deka. When I first saw the show it reminded me of the A-Team meets 21 Jumpstreet. I say the A-Team because hundreds of bullets are fired at the school girl cops without any injuries and 21 Jumpstreet because of the undercover cop angle. There is really no Western comparsion and that's what I like about it.After watching the show, I found two movies that were made back in the 80's. I even went to a bookstore called Bookoff that sells used manga and got the whole series.So when I saw the title Yo Yo Girl Cop, I knew what it really was.The new movie is good in that it modernizes the series for a whole new generation that is growing up with cell phones and the internet. One of the differences between this new movie and the old one is that the old show focused on more than one girl. The old movies spent a lot of time telling the story of how the girls would bond together and form a group. There was more emphasis on teamwork and everyone had a vital part to play in the mission's success. Unlike the A-Team, Sukeban Deka members in the movies did die. In this new version, the bonding developed only between two characters, Matsuura Aya playing Saki Asamiya and Yui Okada playing the bullied Tae Konno.The whole film is about bullying and how someone uses the internet for the wrong purposes which recall the Iwai Shunji's All About Lily Chou-chou. Both films show the damaging results of ijime (bullying) and what happens when society turns away and pretends nothing is going on.Anyone who travels to Japan to teach at the middle and high school level has probably seen bullying going on.Anyway, the story is a little weak because the original movies were a lot more fun and filled with more humor, as well as exciting action scenes. They way the girls would work together is sadly missing from this new edition.The best part of the new film is the ending. The fight is almost as good as anything from the old movies with a new twist added. In the old movies, there was always a big martial arts fight that would involve everyone brawling. This version tones down the big fight but it does add modern filmmaking techinques that make it look just as good as the old movies.If you want to see some great martial arts sequences by a strong female fighter then take a chance and watch Yo Yo Girl Cop. </p>

 <p> Kenta Fukasaku has directed "Battle Royale II" & "X-Cross."  I haven't seen them and probably wouldn't go out of my way to search on the basis of "Yo-Yo Girl Cop."  The torture scene that open the film as Aya Matsuura playing Saki Asemiya is strung up in a prison cell filled with green light was unpleasant.  The story revolves around a Japanese girl raised in New York who has been brought in by Japanese police and recruited to go undercover at Seisan High School where a nefarious plot has been hatched on a web site to apparently use depressed teenagers to blow themselves up.  Riki Takeuchi as detective Kazutoshi Kira apparently has connections to Saki's mother.  We are therefore presented with a world where Japanese police blackmail a young girl and arm her with a hi-tech yo-yo to uncover the high school crazies.  There is a good looking janitor who roams the lawless high school halls and also doubles as a crime boss.  The climactic scene flies by as Yo-Yo misses the myriad of bullets that blow her way and then watches as the big bad guy explodes.  At the end of the film, Yo-Yo tearfully waves goodbye to two young Japanese lesbians who have been reunited due to her efforts.  This is a film that is supposed to entrance you with its action and excellent cinematography rather than make sense at every point of the story.  One of the most entertaining features is the song by Utada as the credits roll.  Audiences should find entertaining their ability to make fun of the film.  Taxi! </p>

 <p> A delinquent Japanese teenager is brought back from the U.S. to work as a secret agent in exchange for her mother's freedom from prison. She is expected to infiltrate a high school and find out the truth behind a mysterious website called Enola Gay, which, along with teaching bullied kids how to blow themselves up with homemade bombs, displays a ticking countdown to an unknown event on the verge of happening. The beautiful teenage spy sent in to save the school is given a deadly metal yo-yo as a weapon and a very special codename: Asamiya Saki. Oh, and she's also given a uniform that is reason enough to buy the DVD (see cover image).Based on the Sukeban Deka manga, TV series, and films, "Yo-Yo Girl Cop" is a well-established Japanese franchise. This causes one of the problems an American viewer will likely have with the film. I'm sure there is a lot of nostalgia and referencing to earlier incarnations. For example, the original television Saki, Yuki Saito, plays the mother in this film. From the bonus behind-the-scenes featurette, which is very thorough, I get the impression that she is playing her original character in this small cameo. As for the new Saki, she is played by Aya Matsuura and is the main reason I blind-bought this DVD. Aya Matsuura, as I understand it, could be considered the Japanese Hilary Duff. This is her first film, and I first discovered her through some of her music videos on YouTube. She is the height of adorable meets hot in the same way Hilary Duff is, and has that pop teen queen/actress thing happening too. Sadly, she has to wear a frown and a tough girl image for most of this film, and she's the kinda girl whose beauty really comes out when she's all girly smiles and cutesy acting, like in some of her amazing music videos. Still, I can't knock getting to see her in that uniform (again, see cover image). The plot of this film is... actually okay, but it plays out a bit goofily at times, and I personally feel it needed a lot more hot yo-yo action. Did I just say that? Well, it's true, the yo-yo fighting is surprisingly cool, and there was nowhere near enough of it considering the title. Of course, that's just the English title, but I still think it should have more. The opening credits with the silhouette of Saki really teases the viewer in this regard.The most important thing I can offer about this film is to suggest you watch it in Japanese with the English subtitles. The first time, I watched it with the English dubbing, which is what comes on automatically, and I found it all to be quite silly and didn't care for the voice they gave Aya Matsuura either. Watching it again with the original Japanese dialogue and the English subtitles, it seemed like a much better film. A lot less campy and downright bad, as it appeared the first time. There are still problems, like the idea that Saki has fallen in love with a creepy guy she's barely encountered, but it's actually a decent flick when watched with subtitles. I was hoping to like it a lot more, but I do like it. The DVD, as I said, comes with a juicy behind-the-scenes featurette and also the film's trailer. If you're a fan of Sukeban Deka or Aya Matsuura, you'll want to get this one. Otherwise, it's hard to predict how you'll feel about it, but it's a fairly decent undercover teen, Anime-style film that could have used a bit more action. </p>

 <p> Picking this up was done on a whim.  I like anime and I've watched/own the anime Sukeban Deka, which was based on the same manga as this movie.However, I have to say that the movie manages to put a lot more heart into the story.  Part of that is the artress playing the main character who wears the role of tough streetwise girl well.  She looks a bit out of place at times, but that is part of the story and the writers manage to use that to help build the drama and tension.This movie isn't for everyone.  By most Japanese standards its almost non-violent.  The few deaths are remarkably unbloody and there is little violence in the first half of the movie.  Instead the tale builds slowly towards the fights at the end.  The fights themselves do have a unreal feel about them, but are still fun to watch.Good fun, and a surprisingly clean action film.  Better than many I've seen Hollywood pump out in the past 5 years. </p>

 <p> This was a very enjoyable movie; slickly produced and quite stylish. There's plenty of action and there's a lot of heart in it too.  I especially enjoyed the theme of loners finding friendship. The acting is a little bumpy at the very start of the movie but by the end everyone has hit their stride.  There a lot of funny parts too, like the scene in the mall where Saki uses her yo-yo for the first time.  Nice costumes and very pretty actresses.  Good show all around. </p>

 <p> Nobody does it better.  And I don't mean Bond, James Bond. The Japanese cinema has become explosively action oriented in the post Kurosawa era.This ain't your Daddy's kind of Japanese movie.  Just enjoy the action.I love it!!!!!....and I'm 60!!!!  I've read all the over analysed critics here-to-fore and I think that's just silly.  It's a Japanese franchise and this incarnation is far down the road from the original manga.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride...cause we don't live in Japan...and we're not going to get all the cultural references.  I do agree with the reviewer who recommended that you watch it in Japanese with English subtitles.  If you can stand that (and I have a couple of grown children who can't...have to have the english sound track) you'll enjoy the movie more.  They never dub the voices right. </p>

 <p> Director Kenta Fukasaku's 2006 continuation of the "Yo-Yo Girl Cop" persona (Japanese pop star Aya Matsuura is actually the fourth Saki Asamiya since the premiere of the hit television series in the 1980s) is a cartoonish and action-packed film sure to please those interested in pretty girls, teen angst, and homicidal yo-yo skills. The film is largely set in the claustrophobic confines of a Japanese high school, The Seisen Academy, and an even grimmer warehouse. Saki is blackmailed by "Organization K" (with assistance from the CIA) to go under cover in the school with her mother's (played by the original Yo-Yo Girl Cop, Yuki Saito) future at stake: she has three days to infiltrate the new school with her deadly spinning orb and uncover the plot behind the terrorist website "Enola Gay" under the premise that "the only one who can solve a teenage case is another teenager."The film that ensues from that premise is a pleasant surprise. Saki is a transfer student with a major attitude, and while the characters are largely two-dimensional they are well played by all involved. The storyline, plus the action are all staged against a very stylish backdrop (I particularly appreciated the use of color, e.g. the sole red umbrella in a sea of white ones.) A word of note: the audio is in either Japanese or English, and English (or Spanish) subtitles are available and recommended. The fast-paced and quirky editing makes parts of this film difficult to immediately comprehend for those who do not read Japanese, as much is revealed on computer monitors and via cell phone text messages; the subtitles explain some but not all of what is going on. This is not particularly objectionable, as it makes an otherwise fairly straightforward plot a bit more intriguing.The film makes clear that high school is a largely miserable experience in Japan as well as elsewhere, and rarely have hordes of teenage girls been less appealing. While Saki is the new antihero on campus, the reigning leader of the girl gangs is the equally beautiful and perfectly malevolent Reika Akiyama (yet another Japanese pop star, Rika Ishikawa,) a ruthless leader who is also a master yo-yo artist. The leads were tutored in the yo-yo arts for several months before filming began by two time world champion Takahiko Hasegawa, the film's "Yo-Yo Coordinator." Before it's over with there is ritual hazing, a janitor of doom, a weird allegory based on "Romeo and Juliet," another secret agent in the student body (or is there?), and a subplot about the chemistry club being on the forefront of both explosives manufacture and hairstyle.Fukasaku is brilliant with composition and lighting, and even when things are temporarily (deliberately) unclear, the direction and resultant atmosphere is nothing short of stunning (of particular note is the scene involving an MP3 player on a city bus.) There is abundant teenage bullying inflicted on Saki's new school friend Tae Konno (Yui Okada in her first screen role, and who actually graduated from high school during filming,) and particularly on the genuinely traumatized Kotomi Kanda (Erika Miyoshi) who was so brutalized she is mute and unresponsive in a hospital until finally delivering a key piece of information leading to the plot's resolution. Ignoring the dubious suggestion that in Japan it is extremely easy to convince teenagers to strap bombs to themselves (the film actually opens with "Melon Kinenbi's" Masae Ohtani exploding in a busy intersection,) the film does effectively use the backdrop of the miseries of school as a potential cauldron of destruction: the evil mastermind turns out to be Jiro Kimura (Shunsuke Kubozuka,) or "Romeo," a seemingly disaffected teen focused on the wholesale slaughter of an enormous student assembly (in a gym, of course) because he had a bad time in high school. (In other words, he went to high school...so what makes him so special?) In a brilliant twist, murder and mayhem aren't the only things on his mind, which leads to an extremely theatrical fight between the two yo-yo divas that must be seen to be believed.The yo-yo whirlwind comes to a head in a creepy industrial building. Saki has finally zeroed in on the den of evil, and the only thing keeping her from dispatching the evil band is (of course) Reika. In a nice touch, the girls up to the conclusion have been shown in demure and conservative school uniforms, but once the lines of good and bad have been delineated, the costumes change for the dramatically more interesting: Saki strides toward the action confidently in a black leather catsuit, which is stunning. Upon entry to the building she discovers Reika in an even more amazing two piece outfit in black leather. This duel has, of course, been in the making the entire movie, and given Saki's initial miscues with her yo-yo in a shopping mall (in a very amusing scene) definitely seem to put her at a disadvantage in the fight. The battle includes many nail-biters, CGI yo-yo effects that are fairly effective, martial arts, plot revelations, and much insight into the motivations of some of the key players. The fight is obviously quite over the top, particularly so with the James Bond-style spinning yo-yo blades of death moment. While Reika is deadly with a yo-yo, Romeo brings a sword to the fight (now that string seems like a weak point, huh?) and his henchmen bring even stronger firepower. The blond hair reveal and ickiest kiss ever set the stage for a morality play showdown, and the ending is a stunner that will not disappoint.Although I didn't expect much from this film, I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. Despite its obvious anime-themed (and executed) plotline, when viewed for what it is, it's quite pleasant: think of it as a spaghetti western with pretty girls and yo-yos instead of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and pistols. The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly the two female leads Matsuura and Ishikawa. Equally perfect in their parts are Kubozuka and Saki's Organization K handler Detective Kira (Riki Takeuchi) who normally plays an unsympathetic heavy in most of his films, though here he plays a tough guy with a definite soft side and troubled past under his rough exterior. Fukasaku's direction and pacing add immeasurably to the underlying simple premise, and locations, sets, and lighting are all picture perfect (though there a few flaws in the DVD transfer, they are minor and inoffensive.) The DVD also features a 42 minute "Making of: 'Yo-Yo Girl Mission'" (the original Japanese title) documentary which is interesting and highly recommended as well as the original Japanese trailer.Although "Yo-Yo Girl Cop" is a youth-oriented action movie, it is far more entertaining that the vast majority of films in that crowded genre. While not particularly breaking any new cinematic ground, it's an involving diversion that is filmed beautifully, is well acted and directed, and is never boring even when it goes way over the top. </p>

 <p> "YO-YO GIRL COP" has the kind of title that anyone shouldn't take seriously, and quite frankly, that's the only way to approach this latest film from Kenta Fukasaku(Asst. 2nd unit Director of Battle Royale, Geisha House). The film is freely adapted to manga of the same name, therefore, like I said, not to be taken seriously. C'mon, it is about a hot girl who uses a "Yo-yo" to bash bad guys for crying out loud..Don't expect an award- winning feature.Aya Matsuura plays Asamiya Saki, a trouble-making girl with a complex past. Apparently, her mother is accused of espionage in the U.S., and to have the Japanese government plea bargain for her life, Saki must infiltrate the Seisen academy under the supervision of Kira, "Department K". She has 3 days to find out the truth about the mystery behind the mysterious countdown on a peculiar website, "Enola Gay"(named after the plane) and to help her mother. On the race against time, she encounters bullies, indifferent teachers and an odd female Student who may hold the key in unraveling the mystery and to prevent a terrorist group's apocalyptic plot.Despite its faults, Yo-Yo girl cop delivers hard-hitting action with an anime touch, complete with intimidatingly sexy poses, an eccentric bad guy, outrageous gadgets and dominatrix outfits. Sexy Aya Matsuura fits the title role and hottie Rika Ishikawa plays her main nemesis. However, the occasional slapstick comedy seems out of place at times, it makes me grind my teeth. It starts with action, then comedy, then action, then a bit of drama, then action..The plot felt "Kiddish" and "goofy" because of the screenplay, that probably adults will not appreciate it to the fullest, particularly the main premise. Thankfully, the side-plot and links between characters is more complicated than expected.For someone to appreciate this film, you will have to have at least read the comic to feel a connection and you will have to be enamored by the lead character; Aya Matsuura, and the villainess; Reika Ishikawa(which wouldn't be very hard, since they are both hot). There is always some guilty pleasure watching 2 women fight it out. It is better than "COOL DIMENSION" and maybe on par with "Cutie Honey".PICTURE/AUDIO: 1.78 Anamorphic Widescreen. The picture is not perfect, some scenes look sharper and vibrant than others. There is some video noise but not distracting. The 5.1 Dolby Digital Japanese language track is very powerful and the subtitles are well done. For those of you who hate subs, there is an available 5.1 English dubbed track.OVERALL: People who come in not expecting much, who love ANIME-inspired action choreography and just want to have a diversion should give this movie a go. It is cartoonish, but I think it is part of its charm. It is one of those films that you either "Love it or Hate it". AHEM, Did I mention Aya and Reika are Hotties?!RENT IT! (A Weak 3 stars) </p>

 <p> Who can the police turn to when a website run by an underground terrorist group that calls itself "Enola Gay" pops up bearing a skull and cross bones and a mysterious timer counting down to an unknown event? What about the teenage girl who just got deported back to Japan and who's mother is facing a trial where she is sure to be found guilty and sent to prison? Yeah, good call. Thus is born Asamiya Saki, the fourth rendition of the infamous Japanese crime fighter known as Yo-Yo Girl Cop. Played by pop star Aya Matsuura, this new cop is a hardcore, battle-ready action hero.The film is filled with explosions of action... literally and figuratively. As Asamiya Saki races against the clock to discover who the terrorists are and put a stop to their evil plan, she constantly finds herself in situations where the only option is to fight her way out. In contrast, her new friend Taie Kono (delicately played by Yui Okada in her acting debut) is constantly running away and hiding from the many bullies that rule the private academy where Asamiya is working undercover. Reika, the worst of the bullies (played by Rika Ishikawa) is determined to make Asamiya Saki's undercover position as difficult as possible. As more bombs keep turning up, and the terrorist plot begins to come clear, Asamiya Saki readies herself for an intense showdown with the suspected head of the organization.Yo-Yo Girl Cop is a fast-paced, beat-em-up, blow-em-up rocket shot of a movie. At times it almost feels like an anime come to life. Unfortunately, the cartoonish dialogue and plot tend to hold the movie back at times when it should be flying. When the film is heading full tilt towards the target, with time running out and action sequences shooting out one after the other, it's the best sort of good girl vs. bad girl comic book action. Unfortunately, the action comes to a halt a little too often as the back story is slowly revealed through online chat room discussions and text messages that lead into voice-over.Ultimately, the plot begins to unravel and what seemed so epic at the beginning starts to feel a little more contrived and unimportant. The transition that Asimaya Saki makes from bumbling yo-yo tosser (hitting a wall and then knocking herself out in an early scene) to intense heroine sending her yo-yo flying and wearing what the featurette describes as a "bondage inspired battlesuit" seems too quick and unrealistic. Especially since the entire film takes place over a 72 hour period.What adds a touch of class to the flm is that Yuki Saito, the original Asimaya Saki from the 1980's Japanese television series, makes a moving and effective cameo as Asimaya's mother, the former Asimaya Saki. Over twenty years after Saito immortalized the character on television, and three reincarnations later, she's back to help usher the super-heroine into the 21st century.For those who love japanimation and borderline-nonsensical plotlines involving explosions, martial art fight scenes, and of course characters running unscathed through streams of machine-gun fire armed solely with a metal yo-yo, this is the film for you. For anyone else, it might be best to let this one pass by, for although this action feature, directed by Kenta Fukasaku (Battle Royale 2) has all the right intentions, it ends up pulling in a little short of the finish line. </p>
