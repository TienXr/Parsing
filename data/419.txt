 <p> Paul White has to be without question the best WWE sportswriter given the number and quality of the WWE e-books this Irish author has had published.  This one, his latest on John Cena, is a highly informative look at The Champ and what he has achieved in his career.  Paul White gives us the background to some of the greatest moments in the history of Cenation.  And check out Paul's equally brilliant "101 Things You May Not Have known About World Wrestling" and his e-book dedicated to another WWE Superstar, The Rock.Granni </p>

 <p> What an absolutely amazing book about John Cena, the true WWE Champion, Paul White's latest WWE e-book is.  This little e-book just has so much information contained within it for the superb price that you just simply cannot afford to let it pass you by.  Did you know that John Cena is left-handed and only discovered sports and weightlifting in his teens?  Or that he used to work in the reception at Gold's Gym in Venice, California and only decided to embark on a career in professional wrestling after a wrestler-in-training at the Gold's Gym encouraged him to enrol in a wrestling class to learn the ropes?  Well download this amazing book from Amazon and discover so many more things about this WWE Superstar.  And if you are a WWE fan then I can also highly recommend Paul's absolutely brilliant "101 Things You May Not Have known About World Wrestling." </p>
