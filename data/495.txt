 <p> As a guy, I never thought I'd be reading a book about menopause!  But it was recommended to me by a friend as a means of better understanding women in general, so I decided to give it a go because it was a very short how-to style book.  The Ultimate Menopause Guide is a very handy guidebook about what exactly women go through during menopause, and how to maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle through it.  I definitely feel like I understand what my mother went through in menopause a lot better now, and I feel prepared for when my wife hits that stage -- many years down the road still, but at least I know what to expect.  The nutrition guide was particularly interesting because it tells of the kind of foods women should eat to maintain a balanced hormonal state during menopause.  It's interesting because a lot of the diet tips in there are similar to what one should be eating anyway to remain healthy and vital.  If you've ever known a woman who's gone through menopause, this book will help you understand what she went through.  If you know a woman going through it, then this book should be required reading to help you empathize with her.  Give it a read! </p>
