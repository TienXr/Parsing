 <p> Firstly  The micro SD card was a 64 GB card even though the packaging said 32 GB. Secondly the adapter did not work at all. Third, the card itself was able to be formatted and data put on it. However as soon as the card was removed from the device all data and even the formatting was lost and the card needed to be reformatted upon reinsertion into a device. I wish I had read the reviews before I placed the order. I returned it for a refund. </p>

 <p> Anytime you get a flash drive or flash card, test it to make sure it is not fake first. It's good to test anyways just to make sure it's working okay and you don't lose your data. Just search &#34;fake flash drives&#34; and you'll see the issues people have with fake media from ebay, etc.There's a good app to test the media first and I use it on every flash drive and memory card I get to make sure it is true.h2testw_1.4 is the app,  search where to get it and how to use it. It's so simple and you'll feel safe knowing. </p>

 <p> When we received this card, we popped it into the camera, but it said the card was full. We put it into the computer and it had a read error. We ended up returning the SD card. </p>

 <p> At first it worked great, I down loaded six gigs of memory on the card and it was fine; the card froze up after two days and would not allow me to do anything with it, so I returned it with no problem. </p>

 <p> I ordered two of these because the first one that arrived was a 64GB SDXC card, not the product advertised. So I ordered it again, and got the same problem. I kept the first and just used it in my laptop, and ordered from another store to get the correct one for my phone. I can't get data to stay on this one. I'll save a file to it, and it will vanish later when I retrieve it. I tried to use Windows Ready Boost, and nothing happens. I tried to format it, and the format stalls. After a few hours, a dialogue box appears that an unknown error occurred and the device was never formatted. I try a full format (not quick) and it halts my system. I've tried to use this card on three different laptops from three different manufacturers, and I get identical results.I'd say you get what you pay for, but that would require that I at least received the product I purchased. I really wish I could leave less than one star for things like this. </p>

 <p> I bought this for a new tablet.  It may say generic, but it works as well as any name brand SD Card and I loved the price.  It was delivered very quickly and I was very happy about that.  The vendor followed through with their promises and I would purchase again from them.  Thank you very much. </p>

 <p> This is pretty blatant false advertising. I'm posting to every review here so people don't lose any more data over this generic crap from China. It only holds 1GB. There is no error, so it's not obvious but the data just continues to overwrite and only the last 1GB remains...To LK Global: Regarding "Generic 32/64GB mSDHC class 10 cards" -  This item needs to be discontinued. Many reviews are similar to my experience. The product is a blatant misrepresentation. The manufacturer is formatting 1Gb mSD cards to 32/64GB. THE SPACE AVAILABLE FALSELY SHOWS AS 32/64GB DUE TO SPOOFED FORMATTING. These seem to work until you actually try to retrieve any data over 1Gb. It just continues writing data over that space with no warning there is anything wrong so users are in fact losing data they are not even aware of. The space available falsely shows up as 32/64Gb. Also, these are class 4 speed, not class 10. These falsifications are deliberate, not problems or defects with a few cards. Product arrived 4/30/14, packaged as shown with no tampering. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> FALSE 32GB format, Class 4 not 10 </p>

 <p> As soon as I move any file from my computer to this microSD card via the adapter, the file cannot be opened (that is with &#34;lock&#34; turned off).  The computer says &#34;media changing&#34; after I click on a file (they were music and video) then says Windows cannot open that file type and that I can seek a solution from online.When I moved a file from my computer to a USB drive, the file could be opened fine.  I am not super techy, so there may be an easy fix to this but I dont know what it is. </p>
