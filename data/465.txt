 <p> Outlaw Muse by Lauren LinwoodLauren Linwood&#8217;s talent for writing wonderful romantic stories has just surpassed itself!  This is an incredibly vivid romance set in the American Old West.  The characters are wonderfully written and intensely believable.  From the authentic scenery to the setting of the times this tale is a masterpiece of both romance and the old west. If we did stars&#8230;this would be a five star from me!While I&#8217;ve never been particularly fond of western stories, I have to say this one tweaked my interest and held me captive all night. It&#8217;s a page turner from the beginning to the very end.  I&#8217;ve become a Linwood fan and will continue to read her wonderful stories for as long as she wishes to put them on &#8220;paper&#8221; or screen&#8230;whatever!The story begins in America &#8211; 1859, with the sad reality of poor Irish-American children being put on an &#8220;orphan train&#8221; and sent to new families willing to &#8220;adopt&#8221; (a polite word for child slavery for the most part) children left homeless and some parentless from the cities.  Linwood did an excellent job writing the experience of these children as well as the often too true nature of those that adopted them. The main character children Serena and Bill Sullivan are such orphaned twins.  Promises made to their dying mother that they would remain together were of course, not the case.Serena a lovely girl of ten did her best to keep her brother with her, but due to having a club foot which most felt limited his ability to &#8220;work&#8221; the farm kept him from being selected and they were immediately separated.  Serena was taken by a morally dark German farmer and his wife and son.  She was immediately made to work and at night was forced to &#8220;please&#8221; the man and later his son as well in the pleasures of the flesh (at the age of 10, unfortunately not abnormal for this period).  This horrible nightmare of a childhood is treated admirably by Linwood and revealed slowly through Serena&#8217;s memories.The story continues, now in 1874 &#8211; London, with the sad story of a playwright who just couldn&#8217;t commit to love losing the lover and friend of long standing to a titled man willing to give the lady love, marriage and a family.  Daman Rutledge, third son of an English Earl and therefore having to make his own living, lost his ability to write when his ex-friend/lover died in childbirth sometime after leaving him. Do to the death of his father and his second half-brother, his only sibling left asked him to see to some family business in Texas for him.While on his brother&#8217;s business, Daman learns to adjust to the place and the work as he helps on a cattle drive from Galveston, Texas to Abilene, Kansas. Linwood gives just enough flavor of the times and the trip to let you get to know the characters and the secondary characters are unique and add their own touch to this well told story.The really interesting things begin to happen quickly now, as Daman looking for a &#8220;quieter&#8221; place to stay than the rowdy cow-town, goes to a place not far away, the small farming community of Crombar Creek. When he arrives he witnesses a hanging in progress of a beautiful young woman, he hears many women telling the crowd that the woman did nothing wrong and that the man had also forced himself on them over the years as well&#8230;during the growing unrest of the crowd and the confusion, Daman makes the most fortuitous decision of his life.  He shoves the sheriff (the guy you&#8217;ll love to hate) about to hang the woman, off the platform and proceeds to cut her down and throw her over his shoulder and runs off with her in his wagon.That&#8217;s the setup&#8230;the rest you really must read for yourselves!  Do yourself a favor and don&#8217;t miss this wonderful rollercoaster ride of adventure, romance, love and so much more.  Even if you are not normally drawn to western stories, this will thrill your romantic soul!  We have found a talented treasure in Lauren Linwood and I wish you as much enjoyment as I&#8217;ve had reading this latest offering!Copy supplied by the author for an honest review. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> After being separated from her twin brother, Bill, during the Orphan Train selection, Serena Sullivan tried to piece her life together.  She found work as a schoolteacher but always longed to be reunited with her only living family member.  She had been searching for her twin for over 15 years when she finally gets a lead on his whereabouts.  Unfortunately, the excitement is short-lived as she falls victim to a crooked sheriff in the Wild West and is set to hang for murder.  Her only hope lies in an impulsive stranger who comes to her aid.  Daman Rutledge is an English playwright who came to America on business but unexpectedly finds himself on the run from the law.  As a fan of western fiction I'm always concerned about western's because they can so easily become clich&eacute;d writing full of stereotypical cowboys, saloon girls and wild west shoot-outs.  Outlaw Muse was able to avoid all of that and instead telling a wonderfully romantic story with a western flair.I appreciated that Linwood included the history of the Orphan Train in her novel.  It is a true part of the history of the emerging west but it is often overlooked in literature, television and in film.  The orphan train's relocated children (abandoned children, orphan children, etc.) from the big eastern cities to the developing western towns and into the first foster homes in America.  I loved that Linwood included that and used that piece of history to develop the backstory to Serena and her brother Bill.  It added a depth to the characters that otherwise would have been lacking.Initially I was skeptical about the plot devices necessarily to make an English playwright in the old west a plausible storyline.  It was similar to the character that arrived in the western film, Tombstone and other than a touring group of actors I wasn't certain how it was going to be done.  Linwood once again wove historical fact in with her fictional romance and created a very lovable story!Serena and Daman are truly great characters; I wish that Serena's twin brother Bill and the corrupt Sheriff were as well-developed.  I would have liked to have read deeper into their own lives as well but they are only supporting characters to the plot and the story isn't lacking without their rich history.  The emotions that the story pulls out of a reader are true, genuine and heartfelt.  The romance is tender and protective.  It felt really wonderful to read a romance in which the main male character is protective without being possessive or obsessive.  Beautifully written and I believe it is a novel that will appeal to readers who love romance stories even if they are not usually fans of the western genre.Review by Ashley LaMar </p>

 <p> The history of transporting orphan children by wagon trains into the emerging west is true.  Within this setting the author builds a suspenseful story encompassing a set of unlikely characters: a former orphan woman accused of murder, an English writer turned cattle driver, and a typical western sheriff bumbling the unraveling of the mystery.  The strength of the story is that the author successfully combines two plots interrelating the struggling Englishman's London background and his destiny in America, and Serena Sullivan, the innocent but condemned murderess's journey to justice.  The structure of the story is sound, the emotions of the characters strong.  For readers who look for unusual twists in the romance novel genre, this is an enjoyable story worth reading. </p>

 <p> Lauren Linwood's impeccable attention to historic accuracy resonates on every page of this western love story. The heroine, Serena, has faced challenges ever since she was a child, and has developed coping skills to ensure her self-preservation. But not until the hero, Daman, comes into her life, does she realize that she doesn't need to shoulder all the burden on her own. Watching Serena grow from a woman who doesn't trust or like men, to one who cares mightily, is a lovely journey. The book is fraught with tension throughout, as Serena and Daman run from the long arm of the law. I raced through the book in record time, simply because I couldn't put it down. I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review. And honestly, I highly recommend you add this book to your pile. </p>

 <p> Author Lauren Linwood in her book, Outlaw Muse, draws you into Serena Sullivan's story from the first sentence of the prologue. When she was a child, Serena was forced to go west on the orphan train, but life was not better. While hunting for her brother, whom she had been separated from as a child, she lands in trouble. Daman, an Englishman traveling in the western states to check up on the family investments, rescues her from the hangman.Serena doesn't trust men and believes she doesn't need anyone. On the run, she must learn to put her trust in Daman, the devastatingly handsome English playwright who has her pulse quickening as no other man has ever done. Daman has lost the one woman he felt was his true love and his writing muse. But now he can't get Serena's amber eyes out of his mind.A completely engrossing story with characters that are believable and human. This book keeps your attention from the first page to the last page as you flee with Serena and Daman on their journey of discovery, love and trust. </p>

 <p> I loved Lauren Linwood's debut novel, Music For My Soul, and was very excited to see Outlaw Muse as her next release. And once again, I couldn't put the book down due to Ms. Linwood's unique romance set in the plains of the Old West.When I first started reading the prologue, I was stunned to learn the history of Orphan Trains. Ms. Linwood has an incredible skill of taking an aspect of history, teaching it to us, and using it to start her story. We learn of Serena's wrenching journey to find a new home, only to be split apart from her twin brother, Bill.Flash forward in time to England, where we meet playwright Damon, who has lost his muse and his ability to write. Now here is where Ms. Linwood throws us another interesting piece of history that I did not know: that many English and Scot nobles bought property and cattle in America during this time period. So Ms. Linwood brilliantly uses this as the jumping point to get Damon to the United States...a fish out of water on the cattle trail, that is for sure!Eventually Damon comes across a woman about to be hanged for a crime she didn't commit. Damon impulsively resuces Serena, and thus begins an adventure on the run--and a period of self-discovery and love as a result.I truly enjoyed this love story. Rich with historical detail, Ms.Linwood weaves a can't-put-it-down tale of adventure and romance set in the backdrop of the Old West. I cannot wait for the next release from Ms. Linwood--and to see where she takes me next. </p>

 <p> Outlaw Muse combines my three favorite things--a British nobleman (sigh), a fish out of water story, and the Old West. And somehow, Ms. Linwood has crafted a story that combines all these elements and yet still has the heart of a love story, rife with emotion.This is a thoroughly enjoyable read that is both accurate in the historical detail and deeply emotional. You can't go wrong with Outlaw Muse! </p>

 <p> I received an ARC of this book and I'm glad that I did. I knew about the orphan train, but the book revealed the human tradgedy behind the historical fact. The pages were alive with detail and emotion. What a great way to learn about history and be entertained at the same time. The characters were well developed, and the attention to detail spot on. All in all, a good read. </p>

 <p> Another winner from Lauren Linwood. The history was accurate and informing. Serena and Damon seemed like real people because they reacted to situations as real people would. Descriptions of places made me feel part of the scene. The reader knows that Serena and Damon will get together in the end, as in all romances, but their journey was what was important. Secondary characters also carried the action along with some twists and turns that made their journey more intriguing. I'm ready for Linwood's next book. </p>

 <p> Writer, Lauren Lindwood, takes us on a journey that begins with an orphan train travelling west and on it the heroine, Serena and her twin brother. The historical detail was fascinating and grabbed my attention from the very start. We next encounter Serena about to be hanged for murder. An unlikely hero, in the form of a lost soul English nobleman and playwright, Daman comes - unexpectedly to her rescue.The couple travel together to outrun Serena's captors, a journey fraught with tension and discovery. Linwood deals sensitively with a number of 'hard' issues, not sparing her heroine the grim reality of a young girl left virtually defenceless in the wild west. The character's are achingly real and not your typical romance pairing. Serena with her troubled past and her ongoing difficulties of facing her future. And Daman, hopelessly ill-equipped to deal with his new reality. Together with us, the couple stumble, fall and get up again towards their happily ever after. </p>

 <p> I received Outlaw Muse as ARC to give a review and I'm so glad I agreed to read this book. From the first page, author Laureen Winwood, pulls the reader into the life of Serena Sullivan. The reader immediately has sympathy with the heroine, who was part of the Orphan Train. Despite the awful life she led after being "adopted," she became a teacher and tried to make something of herself - as much as a woman could in that era. When she is wrongly accused of murder, she is set to hang.Along comes the hero, Daman. Sometimes writers give heroes nothing but wonderful attributes. Daman is flawed, flawed by his rank of birth, flawed by the actions of his father. We are introduced to him on a trail ride - he hates horses. On all accounts, he seems to be quite the un-heroic figure - until he rides to the rescue, takes Laureen under his wing (which is not to say she sits by and lets him take over) and gives the reader a delightful ride throughout the book.I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in historical romance </p>

 <p> Serena is just about to hang when Daman comes along and decides on impulse to rescue her. He is a playwright from London who hasn't been able to write since he lost his muse and is in the area on business for his brother to keep his mind off things. Now he has to keep Serena from getting caught. They are immediately attracted to one another and need to figure out what to do next. They have different agendas because she is looking for her twin brother and he plans to head back to England soon. The romance is very sweet and there is a bit of excitement as well, with running from the law and encountering gunmen out to rob them. The ending seemed somewhat abrupt, though everything comes together nicely. I really enjoyed this.*I received a copy for my honest review. </p>
