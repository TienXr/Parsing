<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> This mini-series film is utterly single-minded in its absolute certainty that Hitler could not have possibly been a normal person with any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  From the very start, the child playing Hitler has such a wicked, sinister sneer on his face that you doubt a mother could even love it.  From the start, he's always angry, always heartless, always abusive, and incapable of anything but anger.  Even the death of his mother he snarkily says it's HER fault for dying.From a personal viewpoint, Hitler lives his public persona, but to an infinitely more pathetic single-minded degree; he rambles on and on about Jews, communists, and everything else like an anti-semitic zealot, with no pause in any aspect of his personal life to his public persona.  I cannot vouch for his personal views, or his views on the Jews in private, but a recently discovered historical audio clip shows that the private Hitler was not much like the public Hitler---he had good things to say about the communists, and the Soviet war machine.  You'd not likely hear this Hitler say ANYTHING good about anyone but his own servants.Somehow the film makes Hitler so vehemently anti-Jewish while simultaneously giving him more good Jewish influences than bad---there's the Jewish doctor who helped his mother during her cancer (he could potentially blame her for it, but still a positive Jew in his life), the Jewish soldier fighting alongside him in the front lines, the Jewish captain who despite being given orders not to, pushes to have Hitler awarded an Iron Cross.The film also goes out of the way to include as many shots of Adolf Hitler coming close to death, as if to harangue the viewer endlessly with instances of "OOH IF ONLY SHE'D LET HIM KILL HIMSELF", "OOH IF ONLY HE'D STAYED IN THE TRENCH WHEN IT WAS SHELLED", "OOH DAMMIT IF ONLY HE WERE A FEW STEPS AHEAD AND GOT SHOT IN THE HEAD!" instances, which I believe is an insult to the memory of the man who caused so much suffering in the world.  Maybe the idea of Hitler dying before the chance of controlling Germany is a positive one to some people to fantasize about, but for me, it simply doesn't work... I feel as though it insults the victims of the Holocaust and the War.Another annoying instance is that whenever Adolf Hitler's full name is mentioned by someone, blatantly sinister and evil sounding music plays in the background.  Sometimes it isn't played, but it's a very frequent occurrence.On the positive side, Robert Carlyle, on Hitler's public persona, is absolutely flawless.  He perfectly encapsulates Hitler's voice, translating it in english without any loss in power, encapsulates his hand and arm motions, and the power of his speaking.  Even though the movie makes no distinction between a private Hitler and a public Hitler, Carlyle fits into the role fluidly, the way of a great actor.  If the filmmakers had decided to take an unbiased route, I imagine Carlyle could have done far better, perhaps award winning, in portraying the violent, passionate public Hitler, and a more sinister, secluded, Caesarian private Hitler.Instead, the Hitler in this film, when he steps off the podium, becomes a pathetic, sad little man, ranting and raving worse than a lunatic, with whom I believe absolutely no one would dare listen to or follow.  The movie craps on the person of Hitler so thoroughly, I couldn't even imagine how Germany could rally behind him---he's nothing but a rabblerouser here, and unless every single person who worked with him behind the scenes were as bats*** insane and stupid as he is in this movie, I don't see how Robert Carlyle's Adolf Hitler could have ever risen to power.And that, perhaps, is the greatest insult of all. </p>

 <p> An entertaining miniseries, filmed mostly in Prague and with good production values, about Adolf Hitler and his rise to power, taking him from his childhood (dealt briefly) until the night of long knives.Unfortunately, and presumably in order to avoid any charge of creating sympathy for Hitler, the filmmakers portray him as an always angry and ranting sociopath. Yet, according to most historians, Hitler, despite being an undeniable political monster directly responsible for the death of millions of people, could be also charming and charismatic. Hitler, as portrayed by the Scottish actor Robert Carlyle, is so off putting, you wonder why anyone would decide to follow him. (In this movie, even as a child, Hitler seems to be channeling the bad seed). Some other Hitler movies have been more honest in this respect: the German film Downfall is the first movie that comes to mind, but even the little known Hollywood film from 1944 "The Hitler gang" shows Hitler as friendly and charming with his associates.I found it also somewhat disappointing that most of the actors don't resemble their  characters much: the actor playing Goebbels is the one that resemble it most; the legendary Peter O'Toole is fine in his brief turn as Von Hindenburg; Carlyle don't look a lot like Hitler; the actors playing Goering and Rohm none at all. Also unfortunate is that some major associates of Hitler like Himmler do not appear at all here, while the relatively unknown Ernst Hanfstaengl (played by Liev Schreiber) is one of the major characters here.These objections aside, I must finally say that this miniseries is undeniably entertaining and never boring, despite being three hours long. </p>

 <p> Was an excellent DVD. Arrived on time, was a great price and was new to boot. Shed some light on Hitler's earlier years, although I'm sure the director had to guess on some things and having read some of the early interrogations of some of his surviving staff it came close to some of what they had said about him, believe me - somethings are left best unsaid. </p>

 <p> A cheap, sensationalized interpretation of Hitler and his axis of evil, which proves to be one dimensional in every respect. There is little here that has anything to do with history and documented facts. In fact, for kids these days, they might think the character of Hitler a bit of a joke, like one of the "bad guys" in all these action films - he's just not believable, a cartoon character of the evil Hitler he really was.  Unfortunately, young modern audiences will not appreciate through this film the "banality of evil" that Hitler represents, and which surrounds them every day.  The warning to beware such men and their evil is lost in the melodramatics of the performances.  Much conjecture is utilized to fill in rather sparse historical facts relating to earlier periods of Hitler's life.  That being said, Carlyle's over-the-top rendition of Hitler is quite entertaining if you ignore who he is mean't to be, and the historical inacurracies. If you like Carlyle, buy it to see his performance.  If you want history, I recommend "Hitler's last ten days", with Alec Guiness masterfully playing the role of the Fuhrer as no other could or ever will again. </p>

 <p> I gave "The Rise of Evil" 5 stars because that's what it deserves.  The show is extremely well-constructed, cast, and directed, even if the screenplay takes some liberties with history along the way.  Yes, the story could have gotten along without the dog beating scene, the one where Hitler's father abuses him violently, and probably a few others.  But the dramatic effect would have been impaired.I watched the "making of" documentary that came with my DVD before I sat down to view the 3-hour movie.  Then, I watched the documentary again after seeing the show.  I'd recommend this approach to others to understand why the producer and director were subject to such criticism before and after the film was finished.When this miniseries first came out we going out of town and totally missed it.  My wife and I watch very little network TV because it doesn't seem like it's designed for thinking adults.  This program is very much the exception and should be a must for anyone interested in world events and the dangers of facism.Any review of this program must include comments on the performance of Robert Carlyle who plays the adult Hitler.  Although the very Scottish Mr. Carlyle may be small in stature and far-removed from Hitler's teutonic roots he is mesmerizing as der Fuehrer.  Carlyle captures the part so well you worry about what he could possibly do in the future to escape type-casting.  It's all there: the iron will, the vicious temper, the evil political genius.  Scary, truly scary.The other actors in the show do very well, too, and there are a lot of well-defined characters.  Peter O'Toole's role in the movie is limited but he does a fine job as President Hindenburg.  The decent people who are steam-rolled by the 3rd Reich were sorry victims, indeed, but that's the way it must have been.There were some characters who were notable by their absence, like Heinrich Himmler, Reinhold Heydrich, and Martin Bormann. Also missing was much on Nazi mysticism and the occult. Maybe these missing pieces are being held for a sequel.  I'd certainly be interested if there were one. </p>

 <p> HITLER: The Rise of Evil is a TV miniseries that focuses on the early personal development of Hitler & the fledgling National Socialist Movement. The movie clearly demonstrates the fact that without the support of the major capitalists in Germany, the phenomena of Hitler & the Third Reich would never have occurred. This is an important point & one that the German capitalists & their counterparts in the Allied countries would like very much to forget. This selective forgetfulness also applied to the Nazi technocrats & scientists--once abhorred as vile Huns--suddenly transformed into 'good patriots' as the West (particularly the United Sates) scooped them up to invent new scientific horrors for an unsuspecting global society.The movie presents flashes of the personal life of Hitler framed within the context of the development of the Nazi Party from its backroom infancy to the full-fledged totalitarian re-organizer of German society as a sort of New Rome.Robert Carlyle is interesting as Hitler, but I felt he was miscast just because of his thin, almost willowy appearance. I know this probably shouldn't be held against the actor, but I just couldn't get over it. No matter how good an actor Carlyle might be, I keep seeing him as an actor who was obviously--well, acting. No matter how monstrous the F&uuml;hrer was, he did possess a certain animal magnetism--especially in the early days, before time, drugs & mania took their respective tolls.Peter O'Toole has a more or less cameo role as the decrepit President Hindenburg and, as one would expect, he does it proud. O'Toole manages just the right aura of mental confusion & physical fragility that characterized the Old War Horse in his final months. This is another instance where the movie clearly demonstrates that, in addition to the capitalist's purse strings, Hitler took advantage of Hindenburg's weakness for his own ends. Indeed, Hindenburg represented the political weakness of German bourgeois society as a whole in post World War I years.I thought that Julianna Marguiles & Mathew Modine were very good as the American German husband & wife visiting "the homeland" & who get embroiled in the infectious optimism & energy that seized Berlin with the ascendancy of Hitler first as Chancellor, then as total Dictator. Marguiles develops a dark fascination with Hitler, as he begins to dominate her. Finally the husband can't take anymore and leaves for America alone.Another scene that I thought was extremely revealing & excellently presented was the "dark cabaret" scene. Just from a theatrical point of view it was stunning--and very difficult to describe for people unfamiliar with this type of entertainment. It often involved lewdness, political/racial parody & transvestitism all framed in music & dance numbers. The contemporary performing company SHOCKHEADED PETER come very close to conveying the feel of dark cabaret--in fact, they are dark cabaret--without the racism.This is a good film and Christian Duguay does a great job directing. </p>

 <p> I had very low expectations for this English language movie - saw some stills from the movie and the British/Scottish actor playing Hitler Robert Carlyle didn't look the part - with the title "The Rise of Evil" - I thought it would be a typical "OH THOSE NAZIS ARE SO COMPLETELY EVIL".I am familiar with the true history and this movie is the best depiction of the character and events I have seen.Robert Carlyle is very believable as Hitler - who appears from seemingly nowhere, a nobody and yet a spokesman for everybody in this chaotic, distressful time for Germans, in Bavaria and everywhere.Robert Carlyle does an excellent job of showing how the loner Hitler who thinks about everything yet seems to have no friends or associates outside of a association with the German army and with Germany, German mythology - he finds his voice and quickly connects with large groups of workers, ex soldiers and then... he is introduced into high, rich German society and connects just as well with them, he is a charmer and not really an actor, he is what he is and he is the man of the time.Yes, there are some liberties taken from history - the depiction of Hitler's WW I combat service looks to portray Hitler as not a great soldier, kind of a psycho let to the front who beats dogs. Hitler never beat dogs, he loved dogs, more than a lot of people, sad to say.Anyway, the movie is excellent and shows a glimpse of the power of a messianic figure, who comes from nowhere yet everywhere.Excellent movie. </p>

 <p> Reading through the reviews, I am irked at the pathetic allegation that those who find this mini-series objectionable are the "PC crowd". Because, you know, Hitler was so scrupulously PC.Carlyle is a very good actor, but here he is terrible. Hitler, the historical figure, was able to engineer a political system which perpetrated one of the worst genocides in history. His racist world view led directly to unimaginable catastrophe.But this show's Hitler is a born Child of Satan, a snivelling and greedy coward surrounded by conveniently helpful Jews, muttering madly under his breath from the outset.  Small children instinctively shy away from him. Little dogs are beaten by him for no good reason (in direct conflict with the real Hitler's rather creepy love of dogs like his Blondi). His rise to power seems to be explained by the hypnotic effect of his sinister moustache.In short, this very fictional Hitler is so clearly off-the-charts insane from the get-go that he would not have come close to rising to the status of Chancellor. The title probably gives it away. This is a Rise of Evil, not a rise to evil. It sacrifices any sense of complexity or even reality in the name of yelling repeatedly at us that Hitler was a very very very bad man, even as a five year old.Such a wasted opportunity, given the remarkable production values. </p>

 <p> I saw this when it first came on CBS. Such an excellent cast, excellent setting, yet the dialogue and overall portrayal of Hitler were poor at best. It is as though the good writers were off that week. I recommend "Downfall" or "Conspiracy" for a portrayal of Nazi politics, not this. This film had so much potential to be good and it was utterly ruined. </p>

 <p> What it is to be truly frightened of a person. Ever been locked in a place with a lunatic who has extreme rages? That was my message from this movie. And Hitler was a lunatic who could promise so much to his frightened destitute country. In those circumstances the starving Germans went along with his plans both for prosperity and for fear of his evil power. Robert Carlyle's eyes do the job perfectly and he captures Hitler's voice and delivery. I agree with many other reviewers in awarding 5 stars. It's not a movie that you enjoy but it's also not one that you can easily stop watching once started. Moreover, it's a warning to us all. </p>

 <p> It was not a good analysis of the early life of Hitler and the hype behind it was more a product of CBS rather than any real concerns about a sympathetic portrayal of Adolph Hitler. To have done this properly Hitler's childhood would have to generate sympathy; he was and abused child after all. I don't think fear of Hitler is a problem since Stalin went on to keep killing and killed more than him as a contemporary mass murdering  head of state. But nobody is afraid of Stalin even though before he died he began his own persecution of the Jews. In the end we have learned nothing from Hitler or Stalin because the killing has continued, prior to their existence and long after them. The thing I believe that gave the Nazi's killing spree more attention is that for the first time in history we were able to film and document it. If we went to war with the Soviet Union and defeated Stalin we would be holding war crimes trials again and CBS would have a Stalin the rise of evil docudrama in addition to this one. Probably just as weak and thin as well. </p>

He is really good in everything he does and he is a pleasure to watch. </p>

<h2> review.text </h2>

 <p> The last part of this movie is great. from the time hitler comes back from the world war onward we see a more realistic portrait of the man. But the first part is well like we are watching a premade monster. A bad kid, a bad man who hits his dog in the war. Who knows how he treated his dogs except the last one 'blondie' who he had killed to test the cyanide capsules he was going to use. there are no records that the dog was abused though. He was extremely brave in the first world war and it's not known if his hideously wrong racist views (he could never accept that there is only one race, the human race and it has different colors , instead his views were of bloodlines and bs. but that was not his creation. so we don't know how much he was into overt racism until his meetings with the fledgling nazi party. It's amazing that he was able to take it over, he had nothing. there is no doubt to me though that the rest of the movie is correct in it's protrayal of Hitler past the war as a rascist bore who was also a evil genious. ( he had a very high I.Q.) That he is one of histories greatest villians is without a doubt. This movie is a good one and it's worth seeing and it's not as bad as the Richard baseheart one in which they depict him as a fruedian mommy complex and a coward. Hitler was never a coward ever but he was heartless , ruthless and evil, this is one of the better hitler movies except for his early years where  you think you are watching the OMEN! Certainly Hitler was a abused child but he was still human.  Anyways, the acting carries this one through and it's worth seeing.  The dvd looks great too. </p>

 <p> This is probably one of the most down-to-earth, honest and "true to history" representations of the Hitler story. More importantly, it is an excellent "reference" point because it pretty much covers Hitlers entire life from childhood to power and to his final downfall and death. While many people may wish to see movies about "the man" i.e. those that focus on why did he do what he did, there are many like me who were just looking for the "what happened?" story. This fits in perfectly. </p>

 <p> Was Hitler crazy? Yes.  Was he evil?  How could he not be? But one thing we know is that part of the reason he rose to power was that he was also extremely charismatic and charming. to the point of inspiring devotion in his followers.But the Hitler character in this portrayal seems rather to be auditioning for a lead in the Omen.  So bat  s*** crazy that no sane person could follow him for five minutes.  So evil that no one would want to stay in the same room with him for five seconds.  And that anyone in his company was there because they were trapped, not because they were there willingly. But that's not what his reputation at the time he rose to power said of him.I guess I am sort of amazed that a person who caused the death of fifty million people and brought the world to ruin wasn't considered sufficiently crazy and evil enough to be portrayed as he was, without poetic license. The gross and ridiculous fictions added to this film make a mockery of the intelligence of the viewer, of the facts, and of history.This cartoon characterization makes it too easy for us to overlook the lessons of that time. Evil isn't always black and white as it was portrayed here. That's why evil is so dangerous. But we didn't see any of that mixture in this film. He was portrayed like a young serial killer, burning his father's bees, torturing animals, etc, when the indication was he was the exact opposite with animals. That all his associates dreaded and feared him, when in fact many were and stayed devoted, even when the worst of his acts became known.The paradox of Hitler is not that he was pure evil but that he could charm and inspire so many people, some ordinary and otherwise sane, to follow him willingly into such dark depths. How can we learn anything from this, how can we teach people to resist fatal charm when it violates their principles if we don't recognize this from history -- that one side of him enabled and ensnared for the other.People who watch this movie will expect all evil to be obvious and plain.  It isn't so simple.It's a shame the script and characterization were so weak, because in other respects the production values were very good. I was hoping for more historical accuracy, even in a movie.  This strayed so far from the truth in some respects that it became less history than fiction, and failed to document one of the real paradoxes of that time and one that should be a warning for the future, but became lost in this portrayal, </p>

 <p> I watched this movie and I liked the small part that Thomas Sangster played in this movie. This child is a brilliant actor and should have been given more time in the movie (at least 30 minutes of film footage). I totally liked him in Entrusted a story about the nazi/world war II era. This story is about a brilliant little boy who happens to be a chessmaster who has memorized the Swiss bank account codes taught to him by his mother. He must make it to Switzerland to give the account codes in order to release the funds to help jewish people escape. The German Nazis are after the funds to help get extra revenues for their war goals. </p>

 <p> This is a good introduction to that all-encompassing epitome of evil, Hitler.  While not excessively accurate from a historical standpoint, which Hitler buffs and academic types will protest, the story is well told and offers a wide range of emotion:  you see Hitler as an abused child, an abject failure until the WWI experience that focused his rage, and then as a sociopathic seeker of power as a politician of genius.  It evokes the time very well and has good characters, who are acted with true excellence by the fine cast.I liked the journalist opponent, as played by Modine, who watched with amusement, then mortal fear, and serves as a kind of conscience for the German people in the film.  He is excellent and convincing, along with his wife.  Then there is the publisher and his wife, who are early adherents to the Party and for a time mesmerized.  They too are excellent characters, mirroring another side of the German psyche that becomes increasingly ambivalent as Hitler gains power; it destroys their relationship.  As I was unsure whether they were fictional characters, I looked them up and they are indeed historical figures, which makes this a first-rate bio-pic.Then there is Carlyle, who makes a very very good Hitler.  He holds himself in a way I have never seen him - more often in his career a well-meaning, almost floppy ne'er do well - as rigid, full of boiling hate, and a political shrewdness and brutality that are compelling and still frightening.  Finally, there is the exceptional performance of Stormare as Roehm, the leader of the SA who is eventually murdered for political reasons, as Hitler consolidated his power.  Stormare is a genuinely wonderful character actor, bringing an entire environment with him.Recommended.  It is powerful and fun and historically interesting. </p>

 <p> Yes, the producers opened themselves to a lot of flak with the dog beating scene, but it's unfair to use this as a litmus test and to claim the entire film is historically inaccurate.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  As an example of the film's punctillious attention to historical detail, the movie shows young, unknown, pre-political Hitler (played by Robert Carlyle) agitated by listening to the rabble rousers in exactly the same Munich square, near the same stone lions, on the side close to the camera, exactly where he was standing when a photographer snapped his face in that crowd in the 1910s.  The movie reenacted that location exactly.  This degree of fidelity to history is a constant.Plaudits, too, for the 1923 Munich beer hall putsch and Hitler's subsequent trial.  It is superbly presented, with Hitler taking pride in his guilty plea and then usurping his role as defendant, haranguing the court and claiming its officials are the ones that should be on trial for high treason, since they cravenly support the Versailles Treaty that has betrayed Germany.  We see the presiding judge chuckling and egging Hitler on, the onlookers interrupting with spasms of applause and the light sentence made to reflect the sympathetic (and even delighted) attitude of the court.  Then we're shown his comfortable, sunny rooms in Landsberg "prison", where he's fawned over by the co-prisoner/secretary Hess and the prison guards who beg him to let them know if  "there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable during your stay here".  Hitler clearly has the nucleus of an inspired and worshipful following as his prison term begins in 1923.As another example of historical fidelity, as the trial opens, the legally-minded prosecutor introduces a line of questioning designed to show that Hitler lacks German citizenship.  Existing German law contained a provision that a non-German judged guilty of treason could be consigned to exile outside Germany and never allowed to return.  Had THAT been made part of the court's sentence, how it would have changed world history!  It was at this precise point that the judge stops the prosecutor's questioning and allows Hitler to begin his filibuster, with the citizenship issue brushed aside.  This portion of German law was not activated by the court, and Hitler was given nine months of "prison" --- spacious, sunny rooms, a flow of unlimited visitors and the time to dictate MEIN KAMPF.If you're seeking other films showing the personal side of Hitler, two quality ones exist:  (1)Maxand also (2)Uncle Adolf [Region 2.  They take artistic license, but both are reasonably responsible to historical fact and both offer spellbinding viewing. </p>

 <p> This mini-series would've been better had they dealt with the subjects dealt with in the History Channel's documentary ''High Hitler''.  Where they revealed that ''Uncle Dolfie'' had an addiction to pain pills which cotributed to a plethora of health problems like gas.  Supposedly the Fuhrur farted like a buffalo.  He also had battles with constipation and at times he had diarrhea that could polute the Rhein. </p>

 <p> I first watched this in my German class in high school. I was expecting a 90 minute boring documentary. Man, was I ever wrong. It starts off as Adolf as a child. For about the first 10 minutes or so, it shows how his childhood was like all the way until he wanted to become an artist. The music that was playing through these scenes just sends chills down your spine. From this point on, the movie does exactly what the title is, how he came into to power. Robert Carlyle played Hitler perfectly because anytime he got up to speak, everyone that heard him was easily persuaded by anything he said. At times, I felt like I was watched Hitler in real life. That's how good the acting was. Throughout the movie, people started to see what Hitler was after and tried to stop him. But no matter what they did or how hard they tried, he just kept getting stronger.So, the bottom-line, this is one of the best history movies you can see. It's very educational, but most of the time you wouldn't realize it because it's so good. I'd definitely check it out. It's well worth the $11. </p>

 <p> Excellent Reg A/B/C Blu Ray with Dutch subtitles that can not be turned off.  The back cover of the case said "Subtitles On/Off", unfortunately it can not be turned off, not with my BD player anyway.  The Amazon merchant ad whom I purchased this BD said something about "Dutch" subtitles and not mentioned anything about On/Off option.  The studio is Dutch Film Works, I had other Blu Rays from that company, more or less I already knew that there will be subtitles that can not be turned off before I received this BD.  Overall the movie is an outstanding depiction of an evil man! </p>

 <p> There are some factual errors-- Adolf beating the dog; the Iron Cross on the greatcoat, and there have been better actors portraying Adolph, i.e.,Bruno Ganz or Anthony Hopkins.And of course there are many books, which if read, provide a fuller accounting of Adolph's life than a 3 hour film could.But I would advise taking the factual errors in stride, as metaphor-- Hitler did not beat the dog, but he was the odd sort that would have; no soldier wears a decoration in the trenches on his combat clothing, but Hitler was the odd sort who would have, and so forth.And of course Adolph was more fully rounded than Carlyle's portrayal, as the home movies show.But I give a high rating for what it tries to do: Help us understand why what happened, did happen.Watch this film, watch all films about Hitler, read all books about him, starting with August Kubicek and Otto Strasser, then Walter Langer, then, take a deep breath and thank God that you were not in a voting booth in Germany in 1925, 1927, 1930, or 1933. Don't think that you too would not have voted NSDAP.The film's failing is the omission of the inflation of 1923 which reduced the value of cash by 99%, and the unemployment, which reached 45% in 1933. Absent that, we lack the basis for understanding Hitler's appeal. </p>
