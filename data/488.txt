 <p> A very good read. I especially enjoyed the Christian principles included and the way the characters expressed their beliefs. I would recommend that  this book be placed in young adult Bible classes. </p>

 <p> Even  a teen would enjoy reading this, yet it is mature enough for an older audience. More of a female rather than a male/female story.  Loved the answer to the mystery as to why she inherited the property. A satisfying story and ending. Not boring at all. Shows what hope can do for someone, how it can change a life. Lessons were good that the young girl learned, and she was a fun character in the book. I really enjoyed it. Listened to it mostly while doing other things. sat up to the wee hours of the morning, then decided I just had to go to bed, and finish it today. Glad I got it.. </p>

 <p> By Summer's End was a great read.  I love all Rosemarie Naramores' books.  Her stories are real and exhibit Christian values.  The main character, Holly Holton, a strong female character remains strong even though she faces much adversity. She never loses her faith in God. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>

 <p> Another great book! </p>

 <p> I am so happy to read a Christian romance book. This a story about a young woman that never gives up on the ones she loves. Her sister tried to make it hard to love but Holly looked past that. Then a handsome man came along and added to the stress that is her life. But she is guided by a more powerful force than all lifes hard knocks. Read this book so we can get more of these types of books published. </p>

 <p> Holly finds that broken lives can be turned into good when God has a plan for you.  She discovers her sister, Brianna, and the two of them receive good news.... a home!......but will it be taken from them?  Of course there's not smooth going all the way,  A  sweet romance and....... Nice dialogue and actions. </p>


<h2> review.summary </h2>
