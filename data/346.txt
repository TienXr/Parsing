 <p> This one I really did enjoy reading... Interesting and different. A female &#34;spy&#34; captured by the bodyguard of the man that she is need of Intel from but ...The unique names and I like how the author incorporated the different language and decipher it into English. I have niggling feeling that one problem in the middle of the book was going to be kicker and I was right... So ... storyline was expectant to a point. What wasn't expectant the romantic thing (yeah I am being vague but sorry no spoiler from me...) that happened in the middle too.Downfall un-protection because of the bodyguard's um past choices but hey it fiction but I was wondering if and yeah (one of two things that could happen if and well... Yup continuing on with the vagueness... Sorry but this is spoil free zone, a aka no spillage zone here...)Overall a great and interesting read... I can honestly say a 4.5 star read. This was the second book in the 4 part series that I have read from the author and this was better than the last one. Each book so far that I have read is can be read as stand alone. </p>

 <p> OH YEAH!  THAT&#8217;S WHAT I&#8217;M TALKIN&#8217; &#8216;BOUT!CAPTURED IN CROATIA is a boatload of naughty fun and I loved every minute of it!Carew Sloan is a corporate spy, specializing in snagging top-secret information from her target&#8217;s computer systems and she is damned good at what she does!  CAPTURED IN CROATIA starts off with an action packed BANG!  Full of sexy seduction and suspense, CAPTURED IN CROATIA effectively captured MY attention from the very first page.Carew&#8217;s target is Juric and although he is a philandering womanizer, it&#8217;s going to take a little more than the batting of her eyelashes to get him to take the bait she is throwing out, as he is surrounded by a wall of muscled tough guys and if she is going to get him, she&#8217;s going to have to play it smart and cool.[GO TO MY BLOG TO VIEW THIS IMAGE]Yeah, that Zoran is a sexy one, but he&#8217;s no dummy and he is on to her &#8211; although he is not sure what her game is, he knows she&#8217;s up to something.Carew is smart, but she totally underestimated her target and all his flunkies and she soon finds herself in the lion&#8217;s den&#8230;  but she quickly discovers that is not such a terrible place to be![GO TO MY BLOG TO VIEW THIS IMAGE]... PSST...  IT'S HOT ;-)CAPTURED IN CROATIA has all the elements I crave in an erotic romance:&#10004; Strong Heroine&#10004; Super-Alpha Hero&#10004; Power Struggle &#8211; which leads to some scorching hot sex scenes&#10004; Action and Suspense&#10004; HOT! HOT! HOT! SEX :-)I&#8217;m totally a fan of author, Christine Edwards&#8217; work, but CAPTURED IN CROATIA is by far my favorite of all her books &#8211; and I have read them all!  If you are looking for a great read and some smokin&#8217; hot characters, then you have definitely got to check this one out! </p>

 <p> I&#8217;m already a big fan of Christine Edwards&#8217; books so I knew I was in for another treat with Captured in Croatia, which it was!I love these capture/hostage reads and this was no exception other than the fact that this time we got the capturer&#8217;s, Zoran, point of view too which usually I wouldn&#8217;t agree with as I like the alpha to remain mysterious and dominant. However having this insight into Zoran and his past just made him more lovable. My big, bad lovable alpha!I won&#8217;t divulge too much of the story but the background is Carew Sloan is a corporate spy who is on a mission to extract computer files that are a presumed copy of a prototype her client had invented. The perpetrator is charming but dangerous Vasilije Juric. He is a hard mark to infiltrate but with her beauty and beguiling smile she is just the right agent to send in. What Carew did not expect was Zoran, Juric&#8217;s right hand man and bodyguard. It was as though he could see right through her. When she had finally hit her mark and extracted the information, Zoran was on to her and a high speed chase lead to him pulling her from the wreckage it ended up in. However, rather than &#8216;eliminating&#8217; her, he captured her for himself!Zoran or &#8216;Tigar&#8217; as he is known was a gorgeous specimen of a man. With his tiger tattoo on his back, his strength and his sizzling good looks he is hard not to fall for. When he reveals his past and what he and his family went through in the Yugoslavia war twenty years ago, it made him all the more enthralling.Carew or &#8216;Princeza&#8217; as Zoran calls her, is a strong determined woman and likeable from the start. She knows what she wants and nobody will ever take away her control. That is until she met Zoran and although she tried to fight for control she was no match for his dominance.There is slight BDSM scenes but not extreme situations. It is however a highly erotic read and the interaction and romance building between Carew and Zoran is so steamy to read and a delight to see develop. I love that Zoran is so family orientated and his camaraderie and bond with his brother &#8216;B&#8217; is lovely.It was sad to be reminded of the demise of Yugoslavia and all that had happened to this beautiful country in the past but the description of Croatia in the scene setting was beautiful. That is what I love about this author&#8217;s books in that they are placed in different parts of the World, taking the reader to new lands and showing the people and traditions of that country. If you have not picked up any of these books then I highly recommend you do. Well with beautiful scene settings, action packed suspense, a gorgeous feisty heroine and a sexy dominant alpha, what is there not to love?Another acclaimed read from Christine Edwards and a fantastic five star rating from me. </p>

 <p> Carew Sloan is a corporate spy her mission locate a duplicated software crypt that a Croatian mogul Vasilije Juric has in his posession. That was what Carew thought she was being hired to do until she crosses paths with Juric's bodyguard Zoran.Playing the role as a guest to visit a very high end jewelry fashion show in Croatia she finds her target at a posh night club in the city. Carew makes her mark only to come face to face with Zoran who doesn't buy her line and knows something is not right. All seems to go as planned as Carew gets to the target Juric's home computer and then all hell breaks lose!Well to say that this was going to be &#34;a piece of cake&#34; is very much underated at this point because a failed attempt to run only ends up bring Carew into the powerful arms of Zoran. It is there that she becomes his captive and although Zoran tries to get the true information out of Carew she will not budge. He has ways... very hot ways of making Carew talk. The fire is instilled by these two and what makes for a great read. Capture the essence of Croatia in this book. </p>

 <p> Carew is on a mission in foreign country to extract information from a highly guarded computer. The owner? A big shot in Zagreb with more air than substance. What she never saw coming was his security, or rather how seriously Zoran would take this attack.Zoran knew right from the start that the american beauty was up to something. Not wanting to give her up to his employer, he's making her a guest of his home..Suspense, action and smutty fluff of the rougher sort, love it! </p>

 <p> 4 out of 5Christine Edwards is my dealer when it comes to getting my fix for Alpha crack with a little dubious consent that leads into a great romance. Her characters are always well rounded and developed. No immature nonsense and over the top drama. I suck down each book with gusto and they would be five star reads for me if I had a little bit more after the climax of the story. Lorraine and I decided that it&#8217;s like when you work out. You have a warm up, the hard stuff and then your cool down. I would like to see more of a cool down for my Hero and heroine in Christine&#8217;s books. The action and the sex keep you ramped for the majority of the book, and I haven&#8217;t got a single complaint, really. I just crave a little bit more of the love fest AFTER the drama is over. But regardless, Zoran and Carew were fabulous and their story was very hot. I strongly recommend Captured in Croatia. </p>

 <p> Overall - 4 starsA hot, espionage thriller provides the backdrop for an unconventional romance. Don't plan on sleeping once you pick this book up. Do plan on some personal love time.Fantasy World - 5 starsThe setting is Croatia, and it is described in amazing detail &#8211; the scenery, the food, and the violence.Tingle - 4 starsHubba, hubba! I wanted to lick the page. There's a bit of violence mixed with the sex, but what can you expect in an interrogation?Characters - 4 starsZoran is the very definition of an alpha male. Carew is more believable as a spy than many heroines.Story - 3 starsThe plot is fairly standard. Spy gets caught, feelings develop between captor/captee, mayhem results.SummaryThis story stars the adrenaline pumping on the first page and it doesn't stop until the last one. The end wraps everything up a bit quickly, but I was too busy reveling in the glow to care. I devoured this book in one sitting, and want the next one ASAP. Captured in Croatia is a total thrill ride with a strong heroine. Yes, the story is fairly standard, but I was having way too much fun to care. The only problem is now I want to book a vacation in Croatia, and I damn well expect Zoran to be there.Favorite Quote&#8220;He looks as if he spends all his free time doing full body pull-ups. With one arm. For fun.&#8221;For access to all links in this review, please visit [...] </p>

 <p> 10 Sizzling Stars and 10 Scorching Hearts for HEAT!!Christine did it again, wait no she freaking knocked it out of the park.I am so over the moon over this book.How she can write a story that is on the edge of so many wicked things but turn it into a blazing beautiful romance is just a mystery to me.One moment I'm terrified and my heart is racing.The next my blood is pumping for a whole different reason.Zoran &#34;Tigar&#34; and Carew make the most passionate couple that Christine has written to date.From their first encounter they oozed chemistry.  This story was infused with suspense .There were moments of sheer beauty. I loved being in Zoran's head. This big guy had a heart so big it just fit his massive personality. Loyal to his family and so protective and dominating all at the same time.&#34;She is flawless and everythingI&#8217;ve ever sought out in a mate. &#34; (Zoran)There wasn't a chance that Carew could ever fight their connection.He is like a beautiful force that I am helpless to deny.I loved that these two shared together and got to actually have a romance. The description of the home and beauty of the land , rushing waterfalls, all painted a picture of the most passionate romantic atmosphere. But this wasn't an average romance. Two feisty personalities, one dominant man a woman who needed his strong hand. This gave the ingredients for one blazing hot read.I fell in love right along with Carew and her &#34;Tigar&#34;By far this is my favorite Christine Edwards book yet! I'll definitely be first in line for the next. She always gives me just what I need. One man who is crazy about his woman and possessive but loving. Perfect Alphas indeed.See this full review and the beautiful teaser photos at sizzlingpages dot com (meet the team) and NicholeThanks. </p>

 <p> Corporate spy Carew Sloan is sent to Zagreb, Croatia. Now if you have not read this author before you should. She writes romance, erotic scenes and the best plots like no other! In the same fashion as her other books the scenery is prominent. When Carew arrives in Croatia for her mission you get into the descriptions making it even more appealing. The plot, like the other books, is great. Her goal is to retrieve information for a client that is suspicious his plans have been copied. So she must get in, grab this document and decide whether it is proprietary information or not. Her agency handles things like this all the time using sexy woman like Carew when necessary.You will totally love how the agency and it's workers infiltrate the mansion belonging to Juric. There are many details in this plan that rival Ocean's 11. Believe me it is something else.Now as the king of all security Zoran has a suspicion that Carew is not who she seems to be. He is now my hero! I loved this guy and his brother. If you like a little naughty mixed into a great plot then PLEASE grab this series. The others are just as good. It will keep you guessing until the end! </p>

 <p> Carew Sloan puts her beauty and brains to good use as a corporate spy.  Her typical cases involve helping the underdog.  Her current mission to get classified information from Vasilije Juric hits a snag almost immediately when she comes face to face with his esteemed bodyguard, Zoran.After surviving a massacre and the death of his parents at an early age, Zoran joined the military fighting against the atrocities which cost him so much.  Upon departing the armed forces, he went into business for himself and started a private security firm.  He&#8217;s very hardened but has a close and caring relationship with his brother.  It&#8217;s sweet to see them look after one another.Zoran quickly spots things are out of sorts when a beautiful woman seems to size up his boss at the club.  He&#8217;s nice enough to offer her warning, but Carew doesn&#8217;t take it.  After she gets the info she needs, she makes a run for it.  Unfortunately, her escape doesn&#8217;t go as planned.This has to be one of the best prologues I&#8217;ve read.  It starts with a high speed car chase.  Talk about pulling me into the story.  It ends with Zoran saying, &#8220;You&#8217;re mine now, princeza.&#8221;  Oy, it was red-hot!  First off, I love the name Carew.  With romance novels you get all kinds of different and unique names; some work well and some don&#8217;t but this one is great.This is the fourth title I&#8217;ve read by Christine Edwards and it was definitely my favorite.  She has a penchant for great, grunty alpha males with a soft side and feisty, smart heroines who don&#8217;t always like to listen to good advice.  I think with this volume the author has made some subtle changes in the characters&#8217; approach to situations they are thrown in and it made a notable improvement in how I perceived everything as a whole.  It has everything I look for in an erotic romance; great characters, suspense, drama, and hot sex!Rating:  4.75 stars~Complimentary copy received in exchange for honest review.~ </p>

 <p> It just keeps getting better and better with Christine Edward's books.  This book had me hooked from the beginning - especially once Zoran, in his incredibly sexy Croatian accent,  uttered the words...&#34;You're mine now, princeza.&#34;After Zoran frees her out of her crashed car that she's trapped in, Carew can't decide if he is her captor or rescuer.  No way is Zoran returning her to his boss - he knows what Juric will do to her and Zoran has no intention of any more harm coming to her.  At the bar he was immediately attracted to her, she's exactly what he's been waiting for.  So he takes her back to his home - where no woman has been invited before.Zoran doesn't mess around either - he's all sexy Dom and he's straight with Carew right from the beginning.  If she doesn't do what he asks.....well, there are consequences.  Consequences that bring both pain and pleasure.  Carew doesn't want to give in, she's stubborn as hell - and she'll gladly pay the consequences for her defiance, and along the way she starts to fall for Zoran and all that he can give her.  But the future is unclear, as to whether he'll let her go home or he'll keep her for himself - or will either be an option.I totally fell in love with Zoran.  Even with all his dominating ways - he continually showed how much he truly cared for Carew.  The best part is always when a kick-ass, strong-willed heroine like Carew, finally submits to a Dom like Zoran, who will treasure what she is giving to them by submitting.  I absolutely loved the romantic suspense storyline of this book - and as always I'll be anticipating the next book from Christine Edwards! </p>
