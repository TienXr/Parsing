 <p> In this succinct guide, Flora Brown, PhD. offers advice you can refer to any time you feel stuck in pretty much any area of life. Simple points about procrastination, when NOT to putt all your ducks in a row, and self confidence boosters can perk you up in the moments you feel lost or  immobilized without knowing why.I especially like the reminder about buying the building - before making the purchase she and her husband didn't own the building. So if something caused them to no longer own it, well, they would simply be back where they stated.Keep this little treasure trove handy to get you through your more challenging ventures. </p>

 <p> Wow what a great book about momentum.  I've been stuck in many areas of my life at different times.  Often I've found getting unstuck and gaining momentum to be the hardest part about making a positive change.  Check out the chapter on gaining confidence based on failure.  It's a great reframe and that one chapter is worth the price of the book alone. </p>

 <p> How to Get Unstuck is a handy little book to have around. It is like a digest version of a lot of other self-help books; it doesn't really contain any advice that we haven't read before, but it boils down the most useful advice into useful, easy to read chunks. </p>

 <p> I am a big fan of personal development being a certified life coach and I have to say the chapter on intentional activity is pretty eye opening. Some days you might have to &#34;force&#34; yourself into action but it pays off huge. Just by taking that first step you can really become unstuck from the rut you are in. It may not happen the first time but with consistent action you will get there. There will be some work to do but you will be rewarded with overflowing confidence again. </p>

 <p> This is a wonderful little book, it is like having a caring friend there with great and practical advice.  The title might seem like a big promise, but I found just today, following one of the suggestions in it, helped me get back on track, immediately.  There was also some very useful advice at the end, which made me ask myself - do I want to walk away from this project?  Seriously?  Because I can if I want to.  That's when I decided that is *not* want I want, and after re-reading the author's wise suggestions, it was enough to get me back on task.  Many thanks to the author for writing this and sharing it for such a reasonable price. </p>

 <p> Getting Unstuck is a simple practical kick in the pants.  When you're stuck, stop and go around, let the ducks step out of line every once in a while, and stop blabbing to everybody and their brother about your goals - it wont help.  Great common sense wisdom to refer to when we, as humans, tie ourselves in mental knots to the point that we can't or don't want to move forward. </p>
