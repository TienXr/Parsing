 <p> While this book is informational and educational, it is a tiny bit redundant.  Seems Robert Jones wrote three or four books that are nearly carbon copies of each other. </p>

 <p> book I got for kindle.there were a few pages that the pictures were covering the words which was prolly not supposed to happen but ya other than that I truly loved the pictures n loved the book,I wish I would've found this book sooner like when I was fifteen lol my makeup would've looked a lot better. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> This is not the holy grail of books on makeup but it is an excellent source for understanding palette selections, brush techniques, basic theory, an excellent discussion of foundations / concealers, and balancing features.  All the looks are cute, polished, and conservative.  I tend toward edgier looks if even polished.  That said, I still learned and am learning new ideas that will be staples in my applications, especially about concealers, foundations, contouring and highlighting.  To get the most out of the book, read, read, read the details - that's where the nuggets of goodness can be found. </p>

 <p> I do not know how to apply make up because I always thought that it was a waste of time. Now I am in my 30s and I found myself unable to apply makeup correctly, for work or for a party. So I took myself for a challenge;Few things you should know:- If you do not know the rules how to apply the make up, the 5 minutes could become easily 30 minutes (at the beginning); after 3rd day I was down to 15 minutes (as long you don't change the style);- You need good tools (5 good brushes, good foundation with matching concealer and powder); if you go to a salon / mall they can help you choose the colors correctly (kind of pricy but the colors will match and you do not have to struggle); I also invested in a good face illuminator and eye primer... I am not an expert but I do see a nice base.- Read the book intro on colors and on applicators, and put book marks at 1-3 looks that you want to achieve... For myself I placed a mark on prepping my face (concealer, foundation, brush) and one on the look (I chose Latina look because I do not have to play with the colors for now);I think this book is good for true beginners or for people who want to improve their skills. </p>

 <p> i got this on my kindle. althought I'm not finished w/ this book , so far I'm satisfied.  it shows you different type of looks and in some ways, some of the steps and brushes they tell you to use is very repetitive which is nice. Only disappointment is that I was really trying to find a tutorial on how to do eyes and contouring.  this book pretty much just tells you to put color on the crease from the outside corner in, or put color/contour the outer 3rd of the eye,etc. but doesn't tell you how to do it. </p>


<h2> REVIEW SUMMARY </h2>

 <p> Great "New" makeup </p>

 <p> This is a great step by step book for the new look of makeup for today.  The only complaint is that the photos could have been a little bit larger. Other than that, worth it. </p>
