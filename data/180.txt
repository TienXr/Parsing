 <p> Casper has been around for many years. It is still a clean movie and not like some of the trash they show the kids today. </p>

 <p> Casper movies are always fun, and this one isn't an exception.  I've seen it a few times over the years and will likely see it again. </p>

 <p> I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that Casper, The Friendly Ghost, is home for the holidays in this spooktacular adventure! Casper is tasked to scare at least one person before Christmas Day. As usual, the kind hearted Casper has a hard time trying to scare anyone, so The Ghostly Trio hires Casper's identical cousin, Spooky, to do the job. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people. </p>

 <p> This movie may have been progressive when it was first released but the graphics are a bit silly and dated now. </p>
